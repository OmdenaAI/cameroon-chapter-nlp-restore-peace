0,Barrister Tamfu Richard To Sue Moja Moja Over Human Rights Abuses,"July 10, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Human Rights Lawyer and Peace Crusader, Barrister Tamfu Richard has promised to drag Chief Ewome Eko John aka Moja to Court.
Barrister Tamfu has expressed the desire to make the ruler and soldier pay for his numerous acts of torture and assaults against civilians in Buea and other parts of the South West Region of Cameroon
He says his attention has been brought to a number of videos wherein “Chief Moja Moja is seen intimidating, torturing, maiming and assaulting innocent Civil Cameroonian citizens for no good reason. To the best of my knowledge, this guy is military personnel of the Cameroon Army and a Chief of a certain village.”
“We can not continue to seat back watching this guy unleashing terror and acts of violence on innocent civilians with impunity,” stated Barrister Tamfu.
He adds that in a recent video he saw Chief Moja Moja kicking a young man into his car boot. “It is not clear what awaits this young man nor certain that the young man is still alive or dead.”
Barrister Tamfu: “I will be leading a criminal complaint against this Chief Moja Moja in the days ahead with other Human Rights Advocates and Lawyers. It is more than time we make him pay for his crimes before a Court of Law. I will teach him that No one is above the Law in Cameroon and that No one can take the laws into their hands as he does with all impunity.”
The responsibility of the Republic of Cameroon in protecting the life and property of its citizens is put in jeopardy by Chief Moja Moja, Barrister Tamfu notes.
Moja Moja who is being described as a ‘licensed’ human rights violator and xenophobe, late last year targeted a 30-year-old pregnant woman, Antoinette Kongnso Gohla, who, alongside her two children, was dragged from her husband’s house in Sandpit Buea, tortured, paraded along the streets and later handed to Gendarmes.
He has on several occasions accosted, tortured, and disfigured many young people in Buea – under the pretext of “huntings Separatists fighting for an independent state called Ambazonia.
Moja Moja continues with his reign of terror on civilians

MMI can confirm that the person who is kicked and thrown into the boot of the car was just going about his daily activity when he was attacked

0,Soldier tells ‘General’ No Pity ‘Your Days Are Numbered’,"July 8, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"A soldier has warned notorious Amba ‘General’ No Pity, insisted that his days on earth are numbered.
Speaking while on telephone with the self-styled Ambazonia General, the Gendarmerie officer assured No Pity that his time was running out.

When his coworkers called, No Pity responded.
“You have killed the Commander of Mbiame, right? We will come for you, your days are numbered,” a Gendarmerie officer is heard threatening No Pity.
“I am No Pity, We have killed him come let me kill you too” No Pity fired back.
“We are coming for you, just wait” The soldier then warned.
No Pity answered: “Is it today that you people have been looking for me? If you have the courage come and attack me or tell me where you are let me come and meet you.”

The students were said to be writing their resit exams at the FET building, towards the Bulu blind center in Buea, South West Region when some “strange men” with machetes stormed their halls.
“They were holding machetes and covered their faces. While everyone was lying on the floor, one asked the invigilator to go with him,” a student narrated.
She explained that after 20 minutes, they were asked by the fighters to evacuate the hall within 3 seconds.

At least 11 separatist fighters have been captured by members of the Cameroonian defense force in Babadjou, West Region of Cameroon.
This comes after the fighters attempted to launch an attack in the town, MMI has learned.
In the very early hours of Tuesday June 28, 2022, the group of Separatist Fighters is believed to have invaded the West Region.
“Frightened civilians were awoke by sounds of heavy gunshots as the Separatists allegedly made their way to the Babadjou Gendarmerie post,” narrated a source.
The fighters were met with stiff resistance from the Gendarmes, who were tipped off.
“The Separatists were quickly supressed by the forces, and 11 of them were captured alive in the process.”

0,"Akwaya: 30 killed in fresh intertribal violence between Messaga, Oliti communities","June 27, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"More than 30 people have been killed in Akwaya subdivision in the South West Region over the past weeks as inter-communal violence skyrockets.
The most recent of the violent attacks happened over the weekend as the intertribal hostilities between the Oliti and Messaga Ekol people in Akwaya ensued.
Persons believed to be of the Oliti are said to have brought hired mercenaries to attack the Messaga Ekol people otherwise known as the Ballin.
“They succeeded in killing 28 people, women, children and men all together,” a source noted.
He went on: “they burned down part of the Ballin village. It was due to the intervention of the Gendarmes that they finally left without burning down or killing the whole village.”
The gruesome killing of civilians in Akwaya
Genesis
The violence is said to originate from a disputed rich agricultural piece of land.
Last weekend’s attacks is said to be the third wave of attack between both communities since April this year.
On April 29 this year, the Oliti people had reportedly attacked and killed at least 20 Messaga Ekol people on their farms, which prompted a retaliation from Messaga Ekol people.
The Oliti people are said to have mobilized and hired armed men who together launched a revenge on the Messaga Ekol people.
In the first attack, about 20 were allegedly killed and 65 injured while dozens more died in the second attack.
As a result of the recurrent violence, some churches have reportedly been shut down in the area and several villagers fled into neighbouring Nigeria.
PCC Moderator condemns attack
The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon, PCC, Rev Fonki Samuel Forba has condemned the attack which he termed as “shameful” and “inhumane”.
In a communique issued on Monday June 27, the PCC Moderator said “it is so terrible, wicked, disheartening and the highest manifestation of evil, that children of the same community should carry out such acts of gruesome murder, men-slaughter and destruction on their own brothers and sisters without any scruple of their consciences”.
Release by Rt. Rev. Fonki Samuel Forba

While warning that the tension between these two communities is still boiling, the clergy revealed that “over 30 people were killed including children, girls, men, women and old people. Some were beheaded. About 5 Nigerians were killed in this attack.”
Authorities maintain silence
Some villagers have indicted local authorities for maintaining deaf ear and blind eye to the happenstances as more lives continue to be wasted.
Population say local authorities have repeatedly been informed of the clashes but their intervention to end the violence are still being awaited.
A civil society activist familiar with the sub division and the recent happenings revealed that government forces, like separatists fighters, have been using the conflict to fuel their different agendas.
“Amba infiltrates and the military as well. They take advantage of the situation,” he stated while refusing to be named.
MP missing in action
Amidst these happenings, locals say the Member of Parliament for Akwaya has maintained a vexing silence, leaving them to wonder who to run to for help.

“We were expecting him as our representative in parliament to react, but he has been quite. We are not happy that he has abandoned us and is not saying anything about our ordeal,” explained one of the native of the area who refused to be named.

At the time of this report, the MP in question was not available for comments.
The happenstances in Akwaya now counts as one of several intercommunity violence in the English speaking regions ignored by government and played upon by belligerents of the Anglophone crisis.
A similar scenario has been recorded in other parts of the North West and South West regions especially in localities where farmer-grazier conflicts had been rampant before the crisis.

0,Lebialem: Defected Separatist Shot Dead By Active Fighters Upon His Return,"June 27, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"A former separatist fighter has been killed by his former colleagues in Lewoh, near Fontem as he returned home almost 2 years after he absconded from the fight.
According to reliable information given to MMI from sources in Lewoh, the ex-fighter, whose only name we got as Sammy, escaped to Yaoundé after deciding to abandon the fight.
After leaving the fight, Sammy reportedly fled to Yaoundé where he spent over two years, away from the war in the Anglophone zones.
“Sammy returned with the hope that all had returned to normal in the village, where he was shot by fighters on ground,” explained a source.
After being spotted by active separatist fighters in Lewoh, he was shot on the spot and killed on Friday, June 24, 2022.
It is unclear why Sammy was summarily executed. While some hold the view that he was treated as a traitor and could not be trusted, others highlight that this is another sign of how things have degenerated into chaos in the conflict-hit regions.
Some shades of opinion highlight the fact that Ambazonian fighters have become judges, juries and executioners, mainly against their own.
Sammy’s body has been laid to rest.

The Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, (CHRDA) has indicted government soldiers and armed Separatist Ambazonia fighters of grave human rights atrocities committed in the ongoing armed separatist conflict in the two English-speaking regions of Cameroon.



The indictment is contained in the latest report published on June 14, 2022, chronicling incidents of violence perpetrated by both parties. The report, which MMI, obtained a copy of, covers the period between April and June 2022.



Faulting government soldiers, the report brought to light Military operations in some localities that ended up inflicting pain on the local population.




“On June 1, 2022, nine unarmed civilians were arbitrarily executed by elements of the defense and security forces in Missong village situated in Fungom subdivision in Menchum Division of the North West region”, the report reads in part, adding that,”The victims consisted of four women, four men, and a one-year-old baby.”




The report also said: “on the night of June 9, 2022, the defense and security forces began an offensive operation in a rebel search in Belo in Boyo of the North West region. In the operation, at least two persons have been executed by the military, houses burnt and property looted”



Other atrocities committed by government soldiers according to the report include the arbitrary arrest of 40 commercial bike riders in Oku, the disappearance of 16 of the 40 arrested bike riders, the burning of houses and bikes in Matondo village II and Killing of three people in Bali Nyonga.



The report also focused on acts of violence implicating separatist Ambazonia fighters in their armed campaign to create a separate state from Cameroon.



“For some time now armed separatist fighters in Kajifu and Obonyi II villages situated in Akwaya subdivision in Manyu Division of the South West have been having problems with the population regarding their excesses,” CHRDA said, adding, “They invaded the Apostolic church and opened fire at worshippers killing at least 10 with 18 others injured”

According to the report, separatists are implicated in many other violent incidents including, the violent suppression of peaceful protest in Oku with torture and killings, the kidnap of senator Regina Mundi, the killing of school children in Kumbo.




While condemning the latest spate of violence, the rights group called for the cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the conflict.



“CHRDA condemns these renewed acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population and calls on the state to thoroughly investigate these incidents and bring perpetrators to justice”, the rights group said, recommending that, “we equally call on all parties to the conflict to cease using all violence against the civilian population and to instead seek a lasting solution to the crisis through peaceful means”.

Renowned lawyer and human rights activist, Barrister Agbor Balla Nkongho and Ambazonia separatist leader, Ayaba Cho Lucas have been trading words over who has legitimacy to represent ‘Anglophone’ Cameroonians.
In a tweet on April 12th,2022, Ayaba Cho Lucas said, “we are aware that a group of impostors from churches including chief colonial apologist and enabler Agbor Balla are meeting in Switzerland.They do not speak for our people and we warn the Swiss to desist from enabling acts that foster and entrenches occupation and it’s consequences”.
In response Agbor Balla Nkongho was blunt.
“you don’t have any moral authority to call others names.You incite violence against your own people, encourage and support their killings.And you call your self a leader.A leader with blood in his hands.You highjacked a legitimate struggle for your nefarious activities”, Agbor Balla tweeted.
Both men have been noticed over the years as some of the actors in the ongoing crisis in the Anglophone North West and South west regions.
Barrister Agbor Balla Nkongho is former president of the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium-CASCS.
The group was formed in 2016 at advent of the current crisis which morphed into an armed conflict.
The goal of the consortium was to fight for a return to a two state Federation as was the case before 1972.
Government had banned the group in 2017 and had it’s leaders arrested.
After some months in prison, Agbor Balla and a few others were released.
The legal mind has since stood for a one and indivisible Cameroon with a federal structure, a narrative that has recorded his name in the bad books of Ambazonia separatists who call him an enabler.
Ayaba Cho Lucas on the other hand is leader of the Ambazonia Governing Council, one of the splinter groups fighting to create a state the call Ambazonia in the English speaking regions of Cameroon.
He also commands an armed militia called Ambazonia Defense Forces.
The group has been accused of committing human rights atrocities in the military campaign against Cameroonian soldiers.
The war of words between the two men came after reports emerged that some Anglophone church leaders and civil society actors are in Switzerland on invitation in a consultation on peaceful resolution of the near 6-year armed separatist conflict. This development was not independently confirmed.
The Swiss government had held similar talks with Separatists leaders including Ayaba Cho Lucas in the past.
In 2019, the Swiss government announced that she was going to mediate talks on the conflict between the government and rebels in English speaking regions.
The government of Cameroon has never made a statement for or against Swiss mediation.Separatists have been quarrelling among themselves over who has legitimacy to seat on the mediations table.
Government and the rebels are yet to be brought to the table four years after the process was announced.

0,Separatists Mend Fractured Relations With Oku Citizens After Recent Altercations,"April 9, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By Atangana David
Separatist fighters have allegedly made peace with the people of Oku following recent altercations amongst them.
On Thursday, April 8th, 2022, a video emerged showing self-styled Ambazonian ‘General’ Bush Rambo, commander of the Ambazonia Defense Forces Oku faction addressing a crowd in a location confirmed to be in Oku in a bid to make peace with the angry population.
“We are all Ambazonians, we are fighting to free ourselves and live in an environment where we can go to school or learn a trade,” he told the population.
Why now?
It has been a rocky few days in Oku, Bui division of the North West region, between Separatists and the population.
The population rose in protest against the presence of the separatists in their villages, accusing them of several atrocities.
A protest against the Separatists was initiated, and the boys were chased out of the village.
Separatists responded by kidnapping some of the protesters with reports claiming that some of them were killed.
They were reportedly tortured and humiliated in Amba’s captivity.
60-year Ndifon Prudencia, believed to have taken part in the protest was reportedly shot dead by the fighters as per family sources.
Separatist struggle “remains priority”
As ‘General’ Bush Rambo addressed dozens in the viral video, he said the fight for the liberation of the land continue. He added that it will be the only way to free the people from bondage.
“…we have talents but we have nowhere to go,” General Bush Rambo.
Some civilians took turns condemning those who came out to protest against the Ambazonia fighters, encouraging the Separatists to fight on.
“…I can not give birth to a child and invite strangers to come and kill no matter what. Keep up the fight, we are behind you people,” a pro-Separatist lady hailed.
“The Amba struggle has been going on now for five years. It is not sensible at this moment to chase away the fighters from their land. However, I am advising the generals and the soldiers to stay away from bad work because we will not tolerate it. Those doing bad work should be dealt with,” an old man is seen speaking during the rally.
Another self-styled Ambazonian General called “Flyover” apologized for any wrongdoing and asked for forgiveness from the population.
“If we go off the rail, please advise us. No human being is perfect” said the physically challenged fighter.
It is not clear whether the population was forced by the fighters or not, to take part in a seemingly political show to clear their name of the past debacle.
MMI is aware that before the rally, a contingent of the ADF fighters from Kumbo was spotted in a convoy heading to Oku threatening to deal with those who protested against them.

He is reported to have been shot death this Friday April 8th, following an attack by a rival force called Bui Unity Warriors controlled by ‘General’ No Pity.
A moment of relief and celebration is expected in Kumbo following the assassination of the dreaded self styled General Insobu, said a source in the area.
Our source who opted for anonymity went on to say: “the former General amongst other issues caused general pain on the people of Bui for years. He was known for imposing countless luckdowns, locking of markets, mass kidnapping for ransom and above all barred circulation of traffic between Ndonga Mantung and Bui for fives years.”
The Role of “No Pity”
Considering the continues pain, General No Pity, another renown Ambazonian general is reported to have made countless missions to Bui that resulted in the unification of minor separatists Commanders under general Mad Dog.
“Since the creation of Bui Unity warriors under General Mad Dog, Genaral Insobu has seen several of his fighters slain on daily basis and today, he took the cue himself,” said another source.
Who is Insobu?
Paying allegiance to Mr Samuel Sako, Insobu took over from late ‘General’ Chacha who was killed in similar circumstances in January 2020.
He commanded a Separatist militia called Bui warriors with base in Kikaikom, a locality in Kumbo,Bui division of the North West region.
The militia witnessed cracks some months back after a group of fighters in the group broke away to form Bui Unity Warriors under the influence of a dreaded Ngoketunja based commander who goes by the name ‘General’No Pity in collaboration with another long time rival group, the ADF.

The incident happened Thursday April 7.

The amba fighters are said to have rained bullets on the vehicle, shattering its windscreen and wounding the girl on the leg. A source told MMI that, ” the vehicle left Mbengwi for Bamenda this morning. While on the way,they met a group of Amba fighters who immediately opened fire ON the vehicle”.

The driver and the little girl are said to have been rushed to the hospital. The medics are said to have confirmed the driver dead in the hospital.

In a footage obtained by MMI, a person is heard narrating that:”we were in the vehicle. Out of a sudden we heard gunshots. Before we knew it the windscreen was shattered and blood oozing. We laid low and started crippling for safety”.

The same person said “… we actually don’t know the reason behind this. After the shooting , the fighters came closer and shockingly discovered that the shot driver was a wrong target as we heard them saying because the driver is not new on this road”.

Another voice is overheard in the footage saying that when the vehicle was spotted by the fighters,they mistook it for a military vehicle. This is because they had a tip off that the military was coming.

A video released on Wednesday April 6, 2022, show those abducted being interrogated by armed separatists. Sections of the video also show that the women had been stripped naked and humiliated.
The women are accused of conniving with government security forces.
An unidentified Ambazonian fighter heard interrogating the women said “since the military started killing and hurting our people, have you ever staged any protest against them?”
Women stripped naked by separatists in Oku
With signs of torture and being stripped naked, the captives are said to have denied the allegations of having taken part in sustained protests against the presence of separatist fighters in Oku.
They insisted their actions were independent of any government involvement.
For the past two days, locals in Jikijem, Elak, Ngemsiba, all localities in Oku stormed the street in protest chanting anti-Amba slogans.
Local sources in the area have revealed that the anti-Amba protests were provoked by constant kidnapping, torture, extortion and imposition of lockdowns every now and then.This comes many months after a similar protest was staged by villages in Kedjom-Ketinguh, in Tubah Sub-division, North West Region, denouncing the excesses of the Ambazonian separatist fighters.
As in the situation in Oku, many of those who took part in the protests in Kedjom were later attacked and some killed by the separatists.

Security Forces Abandon Checkpoints As Heavy Gunshots Rattle Bambui","April 5, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Soulemanu Buba
Security forces have abandoned a checkpoint around Nkwen and Tubah in Mezam division of the North West as heavy gunshots rattle through the area early this day.

“I passed by the checkpoints at mile six Nkwen, Bambui and Bambili and there were not there,” Che, a transporter told MMI.

A student who was on the campus of the University of Bamenda when the gunshot started said, pandemonium hit the campus: “Security forces at the campus of the University of Bamenda, UBa have moved up to the upper part of the campus from their post located the lower part of the campus”.

Classes and other activities have also been interrupted. Reports say separatist fighters in protest of the killing of three civilians, a man and his two sons by the military last week announced a ghost town operation to mourn the victims.

It is not clear if the gunshots are as a result of an exchange between non-state armed groups and government forces or not.
Many Ambazonia fighters have been seen in Bambui and Bambili this day in order to enforce the ghost town operation. Those who traveled to Bambili this morning are stranded.

0,Batibo: Amba fighters crush two kids to near death with car seized from elderly man,"May 25, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By David Atangana
A group of Amba fighters on Tuesday May 24, hit to children to near death in Bessi-Awum village in Batibo subdivision, Momo division of the North West region with a vehicle which they seized from an elderly man.

MMI gathered that ,’General’ Efang, a separatist commander siezed the vehicle from a certain Pa Kweti of Bessi.
Efang and his band of fighters were said to be escaping towards Guzang with the seized vehicle when they knocked the children to death.
A person is heard in a video footage saying that:
“This is Pa Kweti’s car.General Efang and his boys came and siezed the car at Samungong and were heading towards Guzang. It appears they were unable to drive well since it was an automatic vehicle.”

The same person said “at Barassang, they knocked down two children on the way in an accident that left the vehicle beyond repairs.”

The two children were reportedly rushed to a nearby health facility for medical were they were confirmed dead.

What happened to the separatist fighters in the accident remains unclear. None of the fighter was found at the scene when people started streaming in.

Describing the action of the separatists that led to the accident as terrible, an eye witness said the population has incurred alot of harm in the ongoing secessionist conflict.

“When we say this Amba thing is bringing more harm than good, people don’t understand,” a local lamented.

It should be noted that, self-styled General Efang is commander of the Ambazonia Defense Force, ADF, an armed wing of the Ambazonia Governing Council.

Barrister Yong is believed to have been abducted by separatist fighters at the entrance to his compound in Bamenda, Cameroon’s restive North West region.




The man of law was released from the unknown today.


In a video shortly after his release, diaspora separatist leader, Capo Daniel said though the lawyer wasn’t taken by the Ambazonian Defense Forces, ADF, they were right to abduct him.




“He was taken for a legitimate reason … He is not being held for ransom” the separatist kingpin said.




Capo added that, they had reached out to the Common Law Lawyers Association to reveal the reason for the abduction.




This is not the first time separatist fighters or Government forces are abducting or arresting lawyers of the detained separatist leaders.




The lawyers have continued to maintain their neutrality.Most of them have continued to describe what they termed attacks from both parties towards men of the law as victimisation.

The Ambazonia Defense Forces, ADF, an armed separatists militia loyal to the Ambazonia Governing Council has admitted that Senator Regina Mundi is in their Keeping.


The Member of the Senate was picked up alongside her driver Saturday April 30th 2022 around Foncha street in Bamenda.

According to unconfirmed reports, she was heading for a funeral when she fell into their hands.

Early Sunday a video emerged showing the law maker in an undisclosed location with separatist paraphernalia behind her, making a pro Ambazonia statement.


It is likely that the statement made is out of duress.

” I Madam Regina Mundi, an Ambazonian by birth and nationality today 30th April 2022… resign and join our brothers to fight and push ‘La Republique’ out of our ‘territory'”, said the Senator in the video reading from a paper probably wriiten and given to her to read by her captors.


“We ask ‘La Republique’ to maintain their boundaries as From independence”, she continued adding that,”we should note that it is our right to fight and maintain our territorial intergrity”


A statement released by a certain Capo Daniel who passes for Deputy Defense Chief of the ADF admitted that they ‘arrested’ Senator Regina Mundi for questioning adding that she will be used for prisoner exchange of their leaders like Nfor Ngala Nfor and others held in custody by Cameroonian authorities.

Arrest of 40 bike riders in Oku; show of cowardice by the Cameroon Government","April 29, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana
When it comes to human rights abuses, the government of Cameroon and its soldiers have made it a point of duty, not to be outdone. It is now common knowledge that over 40 commercial motorbike riders arrested in Oku a few days ago were the handiwork of the dreaded Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), an elite unit of Cameroon’s defense forces.
Cameroon government forces have been waging a war against armed English-speaking separatists in the North West and South West regions who are striving to create a breakaway state called “Ambazonia”. The war however, seems to be for the most part, against the civilian population than the armed combatants.
The war has been going on for nearly six years and counting. Both sides have recorded severe losses in human and material forms. These have made them always turn against the civilian population, making the transfer of aggression to become a common phenomenon. In most cases, the population is scapegoated and targeted by the warring factions.
The recent incident in Oku is not a new phenomenon and should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the conflict over the years. The axiom of ‘giving a dog a bad name to hang it’ holds true in this instance as Cameroon government forces rounded the said bike riders and tagged them Ambazonia fighters, thereby effectively transforming, civilians into enemy combatants. This claim was and is still being circulated by pro-government activists and military platforms. This raises serious concerns given that such allegations are sufficient grounds for summary execution or indefinite incarceration if we are to go by previous actions of the Cameroon government and its military.
The unfortunate young men who were traveling to Oku to bury a colleague, Mkong Roland, who was shot dead by government soldiers in Bamenda, will at this stage most likely be wondering if they will ever regain their freedom.
Locals were taken aback when the faces of these bike riders emerged on social media platforms tagging them as separatist fighters who have been captured alive by security and defense forces.
No weapons are reported to have been seen with any of the bike riders now believed to be detained somewhere in Bamenda, headquarters of the North West region. This, however, seems to be the least of the Regional government’s worries, as it is keen to prove to their ailing boss in Yaounde, that they are doing something worthwhile. It remains a mystery to many who question how a military force trained by foreign experts can go as far as implicating armless civilians in the name of fighting separatists without proof. Some critical minds however have argued that it should not be surprising, given that this has been the modus operandi of the Biya government for about 4 decades.
Describing the action of the military and by extension, the government of Cameroon as an act of cowardice will not be an overstatement given that the bike riders committed no crime nor have been proven to have links with the separatists. It is now clear that the Cameroon government and its military have decided to go for soft targets rather than engage their real enemy, the Ambazonian separatist fighters. Many people say if the soldiers are brave enough, they should go for the fighters and allow civilians in peace.
It is worth noting that government soldiers have been implicated in several atrocities against civilians following countless reports by human rights organizations. The burning of residential buildings, forced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, and targeting of women and children have been the hallmark of Cameroon’s defense forces in their campaign against armed separatists.
The impunity with which the Cameroon military operates as though they have been licenesed to molest and kill Cameroonians is nauseating. This is surely what happens in a system that is void of accountability and one in which the lives of citizens have completely lost value.
‘Our model of operation here is different from what obtains in the other eight regions. We can do anything and go free in as much as we use the word Amba against you’ a uniformed officer boasted. While there is some element of truth to the last part of the statement, the first part is questionable, given that the same soldiers were found to have carried out similar actions in the North of the country as they battled with Boko Haram.
The distinction between Cameroon’s so-called professional military and the armed separatist fighters who had no formal training and no visible chain of command is a blurred one. The actions of both groups with regards to their treatment of the population are very similar.
While unconfirmed reports have it that the arrested bike riders are detained in undisclosed facilities in Bamenda, many are skeptical, given the long history of summary executions. The case of journalist Samuel Wazizi, stands as a tall reminder, that anyone arrested by the military, could end up dead and their corpse never found.
Human rights lawyer, Cho Emmanuel Esq standing as Counsel for the arrested has been calling for their release. However, the likelihood of that happening is farfetched given that those merely implicated in the ongoing crisis are either killed or dumped in jail with hopeless court proceedings. The case of Kongnso Antoinette, Ex-Girlfriend of the self-styled Ambazonian ‘General No Pity’, who was arrested, while pregnant, assaulted, and kicked in the stomach by one drunk soldier known as Chief Moja Moja, and subsequently detained, but ended up spending significant time in jail, only confirms the caricature that the judiciary has become in the face of military excesses.
So far, there has been no official comment from Cameroon government officials regarding the arbitrary arrests in Oku. Leaders of bikers union in Bamenda are said to have met with Adolf Lele L’ Afrique, governor of the North West region pleading for the release of their colleagues but nothing positive has been heard so far. It is either the governor himself has become too powerless in the face of military brutality, or he is just exhibiting the ineptitude that is characteristic of the Biya government.
Nonetheless, there is no gainsaying the fact that all perpetrators of such human rights abuses are likely to be dragged to the International Criminal Court in some years to come. Until such a time, one cannot expect justice from the derelict system in Cameroon, where governance has failed and the military operates outside of the law.

A self-styled General of the Ambazonia Struggle for Independence and five of his boys have been attacked and killed by soldiers.


The fighters were hit by soldiers recently in one of their hideouts in Ndu, Donga Mantung division of the North West region.

A notorious ‘General’, Try and See and five of his boys were killed during the raid.


Talking to MMI, a man in his 70s who escaped the war in Ndu said, “Their deaths are not a surprise to me. I have warned both sides that anyone who troubles the population would not live to tell the story. Many uniform Officers have also been killed under very funny circumstances because they have rather turned their guns against the innocent population. Many will still fall,” he warns.


The last time the self-styled Amba General was seen in public was when he appeared in a video alongside some of his boys burning houses belonging to the Mbororo Community in Ndu.


This they say was in retaliation to a burning and killing spree against the population by the Mbororos under the watchful eyes of the administration led by the Divisional Officer of Ndu, Adamu Shuaibu Ibrahim.


The population have for five years now been suffering under the weight of the Anglophone Crisis with the separatist fighters and government forces not making matters any better.

At least 40 motobike riders are reported to have been arrested in Oku, Bui division.
They were arrested by soldiers, a Facebook page run by the Cameroonian army; Honneur et Fidelite-Armee Camerounaise, has announced.
The incident occured tuesday April 26th, 2022. The boys are suspected of being Amba fighters.
“40 separatists terrorists captured by SDFs in collaboration with people of Oku ward, NW region. Those people have endured too much and now want peace”, said the announcement with attached pictures of the young men.
It is not clear if those arrested and paraded are really Ambazonia fighters as claimed by their captors.
Independent findings allege that the young men being paraded are commercial motor bike riders in Bamenda who went to Oku over the weekend to bury a colleague who was shot death in Bamenda by unknown gunmen.
“I know four of those faces.They are commercial bike riders here in Bamenda not separatists.These boys are innocent,” a Bamenda dueller told MMI on the strength of anonymity.
“These boys are not fighters. They all left Bamenda in a convoy on Friday accompanying the corps of their colleague to the village for burial. It is so sad they are being rounded up and accused as such. God help us”, another source familiar with most of the faces lamented.
Unconfirmed reports say these young have been transferred to detention centers across the country and their motor bikes impounded.

Amba fighters are aid to have stormed Akwaya subdivision in Manyu division, South West region on April 19, killing five youths. The deceased are said to be below the age of 30.

According to a local who told MMI that he witnessed the event, it was armed Ambazonia fighters that carried out the act.

“……….. yesterday between 8 and 9 pm, separatists fighters stormed Akwaya Town, entered a merchant shop,shot and killed five persons..” the source told MMI.

Amongst those killed was a young girl whose name MMI got as Ekah Estella.
Two of the victims are said to be children from the same family. They were identified as Okana Aldabert Okumb and Okana Titus Tamfu.

Another victim was identified as Eji Divine Oliarh while one of the corpses is yet to be identified.No reason has been advanced for the act described as barbaric by many.

“The atrocities are too much.All these children (15-30years) are very innocent.
They committed no crime”, same source lamented to MMI.

Killing of harmless civilians have multiplied since the escalation of the Anglophone Separatist war in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon.
Government forces have since 2017 been battling armed separatists who want to create a breakaway state.

Government forces and armed separatists have repeatedly been accused by human rights oganisations of carrying out extra-judicial killings.

Separatist Activist Promises Hell To Amba Fighters As Brother Among Victims","April 14, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"A staunch supporter of the separatist movement, Immaculate Kume has promised hell for the Bui Unity Warriors faction of Amba fighters. Her outburst surfaced after she discovered that one of those Amba fighters killed in Kikaikilaiki, Bui division, of the North West region Tuesday April 12 was her brother.

Kume is said to have wailed online after the incident that, Theodore Kigha, North West Regional Delegate of Penitentiary Administration, killed in the attack was her junior brother.

To recall that shortly after the killings, the Bui Unity Warriors armed group released a video claiming responsibility for the killings.

Kume a diaspora Ambazonia supporter lamented that: “My younger brother is not a soldier, my younger brother would not kill an ant. My younger brother was just doing his job”. She said, before promising hell for the authors of the act.

Many however, ridiculed Immaculate Kume as she mourned. Some said, she was feeling the pinch of the armed conflict now because someone dear to her heart had been killed.

Separatist factions it should be noted, have been indicted in countless instances for rights violations and abuses. Among them years ago was the merciless torture and killing of a prison warder, Comfort Ayafor in 2019.

Despite the incident and a plethora of others, separatists fighters on the ground and their supporters in the diaspora doubled down on calls for violence on civilians and other groups not involved in the war

In an opinion piece with Rebecca Tinsley, Nkongho Felix notes that atrocities have persisted for the past three years because “there are no consequences for Cameroon’s government soldiers and radicalized separatist militias’ actions, which have looted and burned homes and schools, while killing and mutilating civilians”.
Recalling that over 20 persons were killed in the Ngarbuh massacre on February 14, Nkongho Felix and Rebecca Tinsley say “only then did the crisis manage to make the news”.
Despite signing numerous UN conventions and promising to uphold human rights, the Cameroon government they add still goes scot free after violating them.
As the UNHRC meets in Geneva at the end of the month, ” it is doubtful that the worsening security situation in Cameroon will be on its agenda. However, the council surely has enough information on what is happening in Cameroon to consider R2P” they note.
“The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visited Cameroon in May, 2019, and urged the government to hold members of its security forces committing abuses to account. This diplomatic language was echoed by the Council of the European Union. However, it is not just a few rogue elements committing human-rights violations: Cracking down on the English-speaking regions is actually government policy” the duo adds.
The reluctance of international bodies to investigate the atrocities in the restive regions they explain, is another factor prolonging the crisis for “history shows that if the international community lets a government know that the world is paying attention, it can make a difference”.
“Cameroon’s crisis” they urge “should no longer be a grain of sand, but rather a shard of glass in the international community’s collective eye. R2P can save lives and start the path to peace. The reprehensible killings in Ngarbuh demand action”.

He revealed that over thirty one “unarmed civilians including entire families, pregnant women and Children were ruthlessly massacred. The carnage was carried out in Ngarbuh;a community in Ntumbaw village in Ndu sub division in the North West of Cameroon”.
The interim government recounted that military men on Friday 14th February “…move from door to door pulling out residents from their houses briefly interrogating some before shooting them to death. A man was killed with his eight children in cool blood alongside two pregnant women” the release states.
According to the release, the real figure of persons killed cannot be established given that mass graves freshly dug have been discovered with the number of people buried not known.
In another case of attack stated, the Federal Republic of Ambazonia said eighty houses were equally set ablaze in Balikumbat in Ngoketunjia division still in the North West by the military in collaboration with some militants of the Cameroon People Democratic Movement; The CPDM.
On why the military carried out the act, the release explains that it was a way to punish the people for refusing to vote during elections.
In Mezam division, the Ambazonia Interim government says military killed people and looted property in homes still on Friday February 14th.
Of all the killings and burning of homes in the English speaking part of Cameroon,the interim government of the federal republic of Ambazonia points accusing finger on the international community for giving a blind eye to the carnage committed in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon by the regime of president Paul Biya.
Ambazonia Interim government appeals to United Nations and all human rights groups to conduct an urgent and detail investigation in the killings last week as well as others committed in the past and for corresponding punitive measures should be taken against those found guilty.
While reiterating their determination for self independence, they regret that the regime of Paul Biya is in a campaign of wiping the communities.

After a bloody period of what has been described as an in-house killing spree on the night of January 19, 2020 in Bui Division in the North West Region of Cameroon which led to the killing of at least 30 ADF fighters by the Bui warriors, there have been accusations and counter accusations of who is responsible for the incident.
According to Amabo Cecilia of the Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF), “a total of 23 fighters were killed. It was a mixed contingent of ADF and sister forces”.
She confirms to Mimi Mefo Info that the killings were carried out by Bui Warriors in the North West Region. “We are still investigating the facts but as long as standing policy is concern, those responsible whether in pulling the trigger or giving orders from the diaspora will be held responsible for their acts,” she adds in a firm and furious tone.
Amabo Cecilia says the Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF) is a national army trained to fight the enemy which is the Cameroon government and not fellow fighters of Ambazonia.
While glorifying the ADF, she adds that the forces have what it takes “to sweep out those who attacked them but they did not because they are trained to fight the enemy”.
On the other hand, Dr. Lucas Ayaba Cho of Ambazonia Governing Council has stated that Bui Warriors should not be blamed for the attack.
To him, they acted in self defence giving that ADF invaded their area of command without prior notification. He says “After Menchum, Mezam and Lebialem, Bui was the next anti-election prep.The dark forces from within ambushed forces. I am on top of it” he said to his thousands of followers on Facebook.
Reacting to the tension, Dr. Samuel Sako, President of the Ambazonian Interim Government which is manning the “Bui Warriors” cautions all fighters in the various divisions in the North West and South West not to be manipulated.
He explains the setbacks of fighting in the course of the struggle. While expressing condolences to bereaved families, he calls for reconciliation. In a release issued on 24th January 2020.
In a release reacting to the current situation, the Ambazonian Self Defence Council, ASC says the Bui incident is an indicator of the ever growing need for a unified force.
“We must strive to minimize internal misunderstanding and by coming together under a united front in order to better confront our common enemy: La Republique du Cameroun” it states.
The ASC also proposes some ground rules to foster unity including increased communication between ground fighting units and discipline and professionalism among fighters.
Sunday, General Chacha whose elements “arrested and killed” his ADF compatriots was mercilessly killed by Cameroon’s security forces. Reliable sources said the Ambazonian camp in kikaikom was invaded was invaded early Sunday by the military. “General Chacha’s and his boys were overwhelmed by the heavy military presence, he was captured, tired behind the military vehicle and pulled on rough grown, that is how he died,” the source said, adding that it left many in Kumbo in shock. The debate and infighting have ensued even after Chacha’s killing and burial.

In a letter signed by Tabe and 19 others, they cite a recent break into their cell. The prisoners that were recently brought in from other prisons they say made away with their food stuff.
“They tampered with our foodstuff and made away with 400.000FCFA (672US Dollars)” it reads.
Despite haven identified the culprits, the Ambazonian leaders say “absolutely nothing has been done to the culprits and they are still among the population gleefully spending the stolen money”.
Stating that they find the situation “very disturbing”, they believe “it is obvious that robbery is part of a bigger and more diabolical plan”.
“Given the current situation, we hereby complain to you as we will other suitable institutions and organisations with higher standards and proven commitment to human dignity and the security of the person” they end.
Following the series of challenges faced by the jailed leaders, many say it is part of government plan to continue punishing them.

He was reportedly killed during a special mission carried out by security elements in the area.
‘General’ Obi was the leader of the Manyu Warriors in the South West Region, one of the many factions of the Ambazonia armed groups of the region.

Just like ‘General’ Amigo in Boyo division, ‘General’ Obi was ambushed by the military as he returned from a funeral which he attended in Mkpot.

Witnesses say he was on a bike when eight soldiers sent to neutralize him on board two vehicles suddenly came out of nowhere and hit his bike to the ground.

They then stepped out of the car and hit him several times till he gave up the ghost.
The bike on which the ‘General’ rode was set ablaze by the military.
All this was reportedly done without a single bullet fired by neither the ‘General’ nor the Cameroon defence forces.

This particular operation is said to have already been on the military’s plan for a long time now as military spies had already been sent to help monitor General Obi’s movement and to spot his weaknesses so that he could be easily taken down when he was most vulnerable.

0,Human Rights Watch Condemns Government Treatment of Jailed Ambazonian Leader,"May 22, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The last few days have been a difficult one for Barrister Shufai Blaise, inmate at the Kondengui prison in Yaounde, Cameroon.
Barrister Shufai is one of other separatist leaders serving a sentence for terrorism related charges at the maximum security prison.
Rushed to the Yaounde military hospital, his lawyers say penitentiary authorities have been adding salt to injury.
New York based international rights group, Human Rights Watch, HRW has weighed in on Shufai’s plight. During one of his nights in hospital, he was forced to sleep with both hands handcuffed to the hospital bed despite being barely able to move.
His lawyers would later condemn his return to prison stating that he is not in good shape yet. Human Rights Watch shares a similar view, as it believes “transferring Shufai, who is immunocompromised, to a crowded prison setting where transmission of Covid-19 is more likely seriously enhances the threats to his health and life.”
To the group, “Cameroon has a fundamental obligation to treat all prisoners with humanity and respect.”
Covid-19 measures undertaken by government it adds should be extended to inmates in detention facilities across the country. “They should ensure that all prisoners can take measures such as regular handwashing and have proper access to medical care.”
“They should also ensure sick prisoners receive the medical treatment they need and that their health or lives are not further jeopardized by increasing their risk of Covid-19 infection” HRW urges.
Since the coronavirus pandemic broke out the Cameroon government has remained silent over potential cases in prisons, sending a wave of panic among inmates.
The country now has over 4,000 positive cases with over 10) deaths.

Known as the Ambazonia Coalition Team, ACT, the coalition has I’m a letter appreciated the call by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on March 24 for a worldwide ceasefire.
In this light, the ACT “calls the UN to order president Paul Biya of La Republic du Cameroun to immediately pull its army of occupation out of Ambazonia, end its genocidal war so that live-saving corridors for humanitarian assistance desperately needed are opened in our war ravaged villages.”
Stating that the Cameroon government has denied to heed to calls for ceasefire, ACT says ” La Republic du Cameroun army’s scorch-earth approach has left over 500 villages burnt to ground, 900,000 persons internally displaced, and 40% of healthcare facilities in Ambazonia destroyed.”
“Some 2.6 million people have been impacted by the genocidal violence. One million children are out of school for three years now. Combatting the Covid-19 pandemic will require mobilizing local and international humanitarian organizations to save lives” it adds.
“Through its constituent groups” the coalition says it “is committed to working with aid groups seeking to stem the tide of the Covid-19, but reminds the world that more than 20,000
Ambazonians languish in la Republique du Cameroun’s gulags while 8 millions Ambazonians combat the surge of Covid-19 daily under the barrel of gun.
“On September 23rd 2019, ACT recalls that it had “declared its willingness to engage in dialogue under the Swiss led peace initiative to end the war and negotiate a permanent lasting solution to the conflict that so far has killed 13,000 Ambazonians.”
The Cameroon government is yet to respond to Antonio Guterres’ call for a ceasefire or that of groups fighting government troops in the Anglophone region.

UN accepts Ambazonian leaders’ ceasefire offer, urges other parties to do same","March 28, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Early today, the Southern Cameroons Defence Force (SOCADEF) heeded to the UN’s call, announcing a 14 day ceasefire in the restive North West and South Regions of Cameroon.
A bloody conflict between government forces and separatists fighting for and independent state of Ambazonia in these country’s English-speaking communities has claimed more than 3000 lives and displaced over one million.
Barely hours after the call for ceasefire backed by the Southern Cameroons Defence Force, SOCADEF, the United Nations has welcomed the move.
In a March 26 note to correspondents, “the body’s Secretary-General calls on other armed groups to do likewise.”
“The Secretary-General reiterates his call for renewed dialogue that will address all relevant issues in the North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon and that will put an end to the violence and human suffering” the body noted, adding that he “reiterates the readiness of the United Nations to assist the authorities and the people of Cameroon in this regard.”
On March 24th, UN Secretary General had made a global appeal for an “immediate ceasefire” to protect civilians trapped in conflict zones from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic.
“It is time to put the armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives,” he had said, asking warring parties worldwide to “Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes.”
Despite measures taken a week ago to combat the coronavirus, the Cameroon government has remained mute regarding the crisis hit regions but for President Paul Biya’s multiple promises to crush the Separatists.
President Paul Biya’s peace talks in 2019 was boycotted by separatists. His regime has vowed that the form of the state is “not negotiable” imposing an-over 20-year-old decentralisation on the disgruntled masses.
It remains unclear if the government will accept the “olive branch”.

0,"Ambazonia Claims ‘case to be heard at ICC, ICJ soon!’","March 15, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"After years of continuous activism, Ambazonian Diaspora leaders have announced that their case will finally be heard in the coming months by international courts.
As per article 34 of the Statute of ICJ, only the State (nations) can approach ICJ for justice. The state can take the international dispute involving their citizens to ICJ for justice. This has raised a few worries as to how exactly the Ambazonia Interim Government hopes to put this into action.
This notwithstanding, expectations are now high among victims of the Anglophone Crisis who have been trapped in a bloody conflict for over three years.
“Unlike before, La Republique du Cameroun would not only have to feel the pain unleashed on them by our restoration forces and the isolationism impact of our covert diplomacy but equally that which hunts them from the international halls of justice in Europe,” Chris Anu, Ambazonian Interim Government’s Head of Communication states, adding that “Ambazonia’s case is finally going to be heard at the ICC (International Criminal Court), and subsequently at the ICJ (International Court of Justice).”
In a bid to emerge victorious, Chris Anu reveals that they have settled down on an “expert firm”, Fein and Delvalle PLLC, a Washington DC-based law firm with past experience “in Ethiopia, the Sudans, Libya, Nigeria and many other conflicting interests in Africa and Eastern Europe.”
“The case at the ICC will pit Paul Biya, and his regime collaborators, including their soldiers, vs. the people of Ambazonia.” The case Anu adds “involves charges or indictment against genocide and crimes against humanity. If convicted, Mr Biya and his friends in crimes against humanity may end up at The Hague behind bars like in the order of former Chadian President Hissene Habre, Charles Taylor, and others.”
The case at the International Court of Justice, the ICJ on its part, he explains, will come a bit later. It will “specifically focus on the argument for a free Ambazonia and the injustice done to it by the UN, and the decolonization process that landed us unequally yoked with French Cameroun.”
Noting that their contract with the law firm does not extend to the long run, Chris Anu says “a lot of work is expected to be pushed through within the immediate six months. Paul Biya and perpetrators should receive their ICC summons as early as this month-end or next month.”
“The legal undertaking, very important to note, isn’t an Interim Government initiative only, it is that of ACT, (Ambazonia Coalition Team). ABC Amba TV shall be broadcasting the entire press forum in the days ahead,” he adds.
This will not be the first time that a faction of Ambazonian leaders are making such a huge claim. In 2017, the then Southern Cameroons Ambazonia Consortium United Front (SCACUF) announced that it had retained the services of a US law firm, Foley Hoag. Similar claims were made and evidence shared on social media that a retainer of $35,000 had been paid to the firm. After a while, nothing was heard of the impending lawsuits against the Biya government.
However, as per article 34 of the Statutes of the ICJ, earlier mentioned, the state can also take an international dispute involving their citizens to the ICJ for justice. This has therefore raised a few worries as to how exactly the Ambazonia Interim Government intends to carry out its plan this time around, if it is will end up being another wild goose chase as was that of Foley Hoag.
Following the violence that erupted in the Anglophone regions and the intensification of the separation struggle by home-based and diaspora based actors, over three thousand are reported dead. President Biya’s regime has in most instances traded blames of human rights violations with separatists.

“As the President of the Interim Government of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia,
Ambazonians from all walks of life both at home and in the diaspora including those in the self-defense groups look up to me,” Ayuk Tabe told Le Messager newspaper.
Talking on their arrest in Abuja, Nigeria and trial, Ayuk Tabe said it has only strengthened their resolve further in the struggle for the restoration of the statehood of Southern Cameroons.
“We recognize that there is no justice to be gotten from a Cameroun regime that violates international law by abducting refugees & asylum … years in captivating and illegal detention, the regime, by its brutal actions has only served to convince us and many more Southern Cameroonians of the validity of our cause and the need to remain steadfast,” he said.
“The military tribunal made it near impossible for us to appeal the judgements of life sentences handed down by imposing a huge cost and giving a very limited time to file all submissions,” he added.
While “one of the causes of the conflict has been the systematic destruction of Southern Cameroon’s Anglo-Saxon education system by the Biya regime over the past 38 years,” Ayuk Tabe said the 3000 death toll figure “have been grossly understated, presumably to conceal the fact that Cameroun’s Military is committing genocide in the Southern Cameroons.”
“When the internationally mandated fact-finding mission is finally convened, the true extent of the genocide will finally be revealed,” he promised.
“Responsibility lies squarely on Mr. Paul Biya and his regime who responded to peaceful demonstrations with force; beatings, rape, torture, arrests, abductions, killings, genocide and massacres. In November 2017 he irresponsibly declared war on the people of Southern Cameroons,” Sisiku Ayuk told the newspaper.
Asked about the different laws that came out of the National Major Dialogue, National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR), National Commission for Bilingualism and Multiculturalism, the politician said “the initiatives Mr Biya and his regime are purporting to put in place have nothing to do with any of the root causes of the conflict.”
With regards for a negotiated settlement, “we have put together a team of persons to represent Ambazonia in the event of any genuine negotiations with La Republique du Cameroun. The details will be made public when the moment arrives,” he said.

0,Human Rights Watch condemns Ambazonian separatists for attacks on education,"March 12, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"In the wake of the Anglophone crisis, one of the most affected sectors has been education with thousands of students staying out of school for a third year today.
This is largely as a result of gun battles as well as restriction from separatist fighters.
“In their brutal campaign, separatists are using education as a weapon for political gains and are robbing an entire generation of children of their fundamental right to education. Separatist leaders should immediately direct their fighters and followers to stop interfering with children’s education,” Human Rights Watch, HRW says.
In a recent dispatch, HRW has condemned the use of violence as a means to achieve their aims. Citing the story of Marie (not her real names), HRW says her fingers were cut off after she was kidnapped on January 30.
“They’ve burned school buildings and kidnapped and assaulted students and teachers for not complying with their demands to keep schools shut. They have used schools as bases, torturing and holding people hostage in and near them,” the dispatch states.
“Marie said the separatists also maimed a 19-year-old man who was held with her and also accused of attending school. Both students were released on February 3, after a ransom payment. They have received medical treatment but have not yet returned to school,” it adds.
Though the government of Cameroon in September 2018 announced its endorsement of the Safe Schools Declaration, one of 28 African Union members to join this international political commitment to protect education during armed conflict, “far more needs to be done by the government to ensure children can return to school safely and to promote alternative forms of education, including teaching by radio, the internet, or television, for those students who cannot yet return,” the rights body explains.
It goes on to quote UN agencies figures; “nearly 600,000 children have been prevented from going to school since late 2016, and only 19 percent of primary and secondary schools are open across the North-West and South-West regions. Government forces have been implicated in one arson attack at a school, according to open source investigators.”
Over three thousand have been declared dead since the crisis escalated into an armed conflict in 2017.
Government and separatist fighters have since blamed each other for several excesses carried out including the burning of homes and extra judicial killings.

The Ambazonian Interim government leaders’ arrested in Nigeria on January 5, 2018 and later transferred to jail in Cameroon. Today marks exactly two years after the Nera 10 arrests.
They were arrested in Abuja for engaging in what authorities of both countries claim was a clandestine meeting against Cameroonian authorities. Media reports indicated Nigeria’s military made the arrest, though the country’s Department for State Service, DSS initially denied carrying out the arrest.
The Nera 10 and other pro-independence activists have been seeking to create a separate state from the Republic of Cameroon called Ambazonia. On October 1, 2017, they declared their independence.
Led by Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, the arrested leaders were on August 20, 2019 sentenced to life imprisonment by the Yaoundé Military Tribunal.
Sisiku Ayuk Tabe has since maintained that the people of Southern Cameroons deserve their independence and will only sit on the table with Cameroonian authorities for a negotiated settlement.
The heavy sentence was also criticised by many home and abroad who explained that it was a violation of their fundamental human rights. To human rights lawyer and head of the Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, CHRDA, Barrister Agbor Balla, “the sentencing of Sisiku and Co to life imprisonment is an affront to due process and the rule of law”.
The right to fair trial is a fundamental human right he stressed, adding that “the Sham process is a reflection of the sham management of the Country.”

On new year’s day, gun battles were reported in different parts of the Anglophone regions. In mile 14, Buea, a car was set ablaze by gun men suspected to be Ambazonian fighters, leaving the area on lockdown for most of new year’s day.
In Taku village, Donga Mantung division of the North West region, villagers say following a raid by the armed forces in the area on new year’s day, more lives were lost.
“The military attacked the village leaving four dead” a source said. Two Ambazonian fighters were killed too another source stated.
“About 7 persons are shot” still another individual in the village wrote to MMI.
The new year gun battles come just hours after a first set of refugees and ex Ambazonian fighters who fled the restive regions returned to the country.
Many say it is neither the right time to bring back refugees or send them humanitarian aid, as the fighting still persists.
The war however seems to have no end in sight currently, as the Ambazonian Interim Government president, Sako Ikome in his own end of year speech also promised to intensify their fight against the armed forces in the region.

Cohen had taken to social media earlier to declare that “Cameroon’s peace process will be an uphill battle as long as President Biya’s troops continue to burn villages and murder innocent people”.
“If he is serious about negotiating an end to this war, Yaoundé must immediately declare a ceasefire” he went on.
Regarding the devolution bill enacted by parliament, Cohen stated that it “is unacceptable because anglophone Cameroonians were not consulted. Current “one-way” dialogue should be replaced by an honest negotiation that will result in a return to the federal system that existed prior to 1972″.
To him, “Anglophone separatists in Cameroon are correct to reject “special status” granted unilaterally by Parliament”.
This, he adds, is however no consolation for the actions of Ambazonian fighters. “Separatists cannot force anglophone citizens to accept independence” he adds.
For the crisis to come to an end, he has recommended that “there must be an immediate cease fire in Cameroon, and the beginning of transparent negotiations leading to true self-determination for the English speaking people”.
87 year old Herman Jay “Hank” Cohen it should be recalled served as United States Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 1989 to 1993.

Why should Nambere’s outing be announced by a pro-Biya platform?…remains the question.
MKPD, government propaganda platform on Facebook says Nambere will address the issue today
Who is Nambere?
Nambere is one of several Ambazonian activists fronting the restoration movement. Fondly called General Nambere, he is known for having disputes with several other activists especially regarding finances including IG IG President, Sako and Tapang Ivo.
In a video released on Facebook May 2019, he accused other activists of being worst than the Cameroon government. He said they were killing fighters on the ground for greed.
This was after he was supposedly arrested in Nigeria before being released. His supposed release sparked more controversy, as critics questioned how a man who is so much wanted by the Cameroon government for secessionist activities could be arrested and released.

0,Defense Ministry dismisses claims after Ambazonia fighters say they attacked North West Governor’s convoy,"October 24, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The Ministry of Defence, MINDEF has said rumours circulating about a supposed attack on the convoy of North West Governor, Lele L’Afrique are false.
In a statement released, MINDEF explains that not only were there no human casualties, but there was never an attack of the sort in the first place.
“This is not true. Nothing as such happened” it stated.
“On Monday, October 21, 2019, the Governor of the North-West Region proceeded to the installation of the Divisional Officer for the MEZAM in peace and serenity” it went on.
Calling the rumour an “immature manipulation aimed at undermining the morale of Cameroonians”, MINDEF maintained that ” the Republican Army remains more than ever engaged in peace-building operations, essential to the free movement of goods and persons in parts of the national territory plagued by the most abject barbarism … a mission they carry out with HONOR & LOYALTY.”
This comes after images and information have been circulating on social media claiming that some of those who were in the convoy were killed and others injured after it was attacked by Ambazonian fighters in Baba in the North West region.
The newly installed Senior Divisional Officer for Built is also said to have been attacked by the Ambazonian fighters, leaving his car destroyed by bullets.
These recent waves of attacks come weeks after the National dialogue that held in Yaounde to seek solutions to the crisis in the Anglophone regions.

0,Two “supposed” Ambazonian fighters fall into the dragnet of population,"October 20, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"For several months now, the boys have been terrorising the population of Livanda, a village in Limbe, South West Region.
During their encounters with the frightened locals, they said they were Ambazonian fighters. This weekend a victim alerted the population after he was attacked.
“After harassing a man at a funeral and seizing his ID card, the man is said to have assembled the population that sought and apprehended them,” a source told Mimi Mefo Info.
“The boys are currently being held in the chiefs palace,” the source added.
Ever since the escalation of the Anglophone crisis into an armed conflict, the rate of theft and robbery in the affected regions are said to have increased, with many crimes and rights violations attributed to Ambazonian fighters otherwise known as Amba boys or security forces on the ground.
The Ambazonian fighters on their part insist that government officials are sponsoring other groups to carry out actions in their name.
The Network for the defense of human rights in central Africa during a presentation at the peace conference in Canada this year, said several armed groups have emerged in the restive North West and South West regions.
The organisation could however not tell if they are state or non-state affiliated.

0,"“Major National dialogue was a meeting of French Cameroun citizens to solve their national problems. To us it is a non event” Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, jailed Ambazonian leader","October 14, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius has stated that recommendations taken at the major national dialogue and resolutions that will be carried out do not in any way concern the people of Southern Cameroon or Ambazonia Republic.
In an exclusive interview with Jeanne Afrique Magazine of 13th to 19 October 2019, Ayuk Tabe Julius says a special status recommended is not the solution for a people fighting for the restoration of their statehood. “French Cameroun and Southern Cameroon and two former trust territories of the UN and therefore one cannot grant a special status to another. So, Paul Biya does not have the power to grant a special status to the people of Ambazonia”.
In his prison cell at the Kondengui Principal prison in Yaounde, Ayuk Tabe Julius states categorically that the Anglophone problem is not an internal issue and cannot be discussed internally without international mediators. To him, this explains why no citizen of Ambazonia or a representative attended the major national dialogue in Yaounde.
On the question of three hundred and thirty three Anglophones arrested in the course of the crisis released by President Paul Biya, Ayuk Tabe Julius says releasing that number out of over three thousand arrested is insignificant. He calls on ‘La Republic’ to release all those arrested and for Paul Biya to give an account for all those missing and killed by forces he has deployed in the North West and South West regions.
According to Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, the war for the restoration of Ambazonia statehood will only come to an end when President Paul Biya will end the genocide. To him,more than 20.000 persons have been killed since 2016, 280 towns and villages have been burnt,120.000 people are seeking refuge in the Federal Republic of Nigeria with 1 million more people internally displaced in Cameroon.
Beside these figures, the leader of the self proclaimed state of Ambazonia says more than 4.5 million people stand the risk of famine today in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
On who is responsible for all these, Ayuk Tabe says military men from La Republic du Cameroon and militiamen men popularly known as “Atanga Nji Boys” have been causing the carnage in the Anglophone regions.
“Since 2016, the destruction in the federal Republic of Ambazonia has been enormous with the international community watching silently” he notes. To Ayuk Tabe, “it is either total independence of Ambazonia or resistance forever”. Drawing inspiration from the success story of Namibia, Eritrea, East Timor, Djibouti and South Sudan, the leader of the restoration of Ambazonia statehood says total independence will be the end result of the struggle.
On the reaction of Ayuk Tabe Julius on the position of Cardinal Tumi in the crisis, he says he respects the opinion of Cardinal Tumi as a spiritual leader.To him, if Cardinal Tumi has chosen not to write his name on the sand of time, he will have the burden to bear. He quotes Bishop Desmond Tutu and other religious leaders in Africa that have championed socio political courses for the interest of the people.
On the life in prison sentence of ten key leaders of the Ambazonia struggle, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius says what bothers them is the wellbeing of millions of Southern Cameroonians suffering in the course of the war and not the release of the those sentenced.
Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius applauds the release of Professor Maurice Kamto and other militants of his Cameroon Renaissance Movement saying it is against the rule of law to imprison political opponents. He however thinks CRM party can contribute in restoring human rights in La Republic du Cameroun.
He however stresses that politics in La Republic du Cameroon does not concern the people of Ambazonia.

After three years of practically no school in the greater part of the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, the boys say children need to be educated.

They have equally promised the recruitment of competent teachers while preventing parents in the area from sending their kids to French speaking parts of Cameroon for school.
On the just ended national dialogue, the fighters say it has nothing to do with Ambazonia stating that what they want is terms of negotiations on how the separation will take place.

0,All you need to know about the origin of the name ‘Ambazonia’,"October 2, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Despite the increasing use of the term ‘Ambazonia’ in Cameroon today, the root cause of the name is not known to many.
Yesterday October 1 being a memorable day in the life of English speaking Cameroonians especially the escalation of the Anglophone crisis into an armed conflict few years ago, it is necessary to know the origin of the word.
On 20 March 1985, HE Fongum Gorji-Dinka, the first president of the Cameroon Bar Association published a pamphlet titled “The New Social Order” denouncing what he said was the gross mismanagement of Cameroon, dwelling particularly on the Southern Cameroons problem.
The educated Christian as well as Traditional Ruler of the Widikum Kingdom said the Republic of Cameroun had annexed the Southern Cameroons; and he advocated the creation of a Southern Cameroons state to be called Ambazonia, a name coined from the Ambas Bay and carefully chosen so as not to confuse Sothern British Cameroons with South Province of Cameroun; or West Cameroon with the West province of Cameroun. To the Fon, no peoples should ever be subjected to the kind of relations his peoples of Ambazonia have had with Cameroun Republic for the last 44 years then!
The appellation at the time was not as popular as other liberation names, but suddenly shot to prominence after government used force to quell protests two years back and English speaking Cameroonians more than ever clamored for a State called Ambazonia. Prior to that however, pushing the agenda forward was not an easy task. From court cases against the Republic of Cameroon to protests and constant hiding, Fon Fongum Gorji-Dinka was one of the most renowned activists in the struggle.
As President of Cameroon students’ Association in 1959, he led a delegation to the UN for preliminary deliberations aimed at formulating the infamous two alternatives in anticipation of the UN-sponsored plebiscite for the Cameroons. After reunification, he took upon himself like several others to fight for what they termed the Liberation, leaving them many different confrontations with the Cameroon government.
On 5 May 1985, he wrote An Open Letter to L’etat Major of Cameroun asking them to defuse the timed bomb, leading to his arrest on 31 May 1985.
“In the face of all this mess, chaos and illegalities mounting daily, we find it imperative to call on the Cameroonian Etat Major to take action similar to that which the French Generals took in 1959 to put an end to the chaos of the Fourth Republic in France” it read.
After his release due to ill health and escape, the author was re-detained on 9 June 1985 at the headquarters of the Brigade Mixte Mobile (BMM), a paramilitary police force, where he initially shared a cell with 20 murder convicts.
The Fon in one of several cases eventually framed a lawsuit in the Cameroun High Court requiring that President Biya acknowledges that ex-British Southern Cameroons is now the sovereign State of Ambazonia with Fon Gorji-Dinka as Head of State, that Cameroun occupation of Ambazonia is illegal and constitutes “an act of continuing aggression”. The 1992 suit also demanded that Cameroun must make an unconditional withdraw from ‘Ambazonia’ and instead seek the creation of the Cameroun-Ambazonian Confederacy as per the terms spelt out in the United Nations Plebiscite.
Fon Gorji-Dinka with Ghanaian politician, JJ Rawlings
He is also credited as one of those that played a major role to the birth of multi party politics in Cameroon, alongside Ni John Fru Ndi, Albert Mukong and others leading to the creation of the Social Democratic Front, SDF party.
From 2002-2015, Gorji-Dinka galvanized legal global actions at UN, ICJ, AU and many countries and is said to have issued a last warning ‘after having exhausted all peaceful means’.
All his efforts however came at a cost. As a result of the physical and mental torture he was subjected to during detention, Fon Dinka suffered a stroke which paralyzed his left side. He was also allegedly tortured and threatened in several instances leaving him to luck and persons of goodwill.
The Ambazonian Flag
Though Fon Fongum Gorji-Dinka is no longer at the forefront of what has come to be known by many as the Struggle, modern day separatist leaders most of whom are based in the Diaspora keep referring to him as the father of Ambazonia.
Despite the ongoing dialogue, they say they are willing to talk with the Cameroon government on neutral ground only.
To Dinka, he is however just a tool. “I am only the little creature the Lord God used to put Ambazonia into writing through the pamphlets I wrote in 2985 on the Ambazonian revolt” he said in 2017 a letter.
Regardless of how genuine or not his cause is, many say his dedication to his cause makes his life worth celebrating.

0,National Dialogue That Coincides With October 1 ‘Ambazonia Independence Day’,"September 28, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Since October 2016, the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon have been engulfed in a socio-political reawakening, with pro independence fighters and their leaders now asking for a breakaway state called Ambazonia.
Protests swept through the streets of both English-speaking regions on September 22, 2017 as President Paul Biya addressed the United Nations General Assembly. On October 1, 2017, the “independence” of Ambazonia from the Republic of Cameroon (La Republuque to Cameroun) was symbolically declared by some locals of the North West and South West Regions now seen as separatists.
Two years down the line, President Paul Biya has convened a Major National Dialogue to resolve the Anglophone crisis, as it has now come to be known. The dialogue will run from September 30 to October 4, 2019.
That the said dialogue had to coincide with October 1 and the UN General Assembly may well justify the fears many now have towards the sincerity of the process. Is the Major National Dialogue only a smokescreen? Is it intended to turn attention from the crisis? Is it a ploy to frustrate Ambazonia’s ‘second independence’ anniversary?
A mere quest for the respect of the tenets of Common Law in courts in the North West and South West regions and the preservation of the Anglo-Saxon educational system in a constitutionally bilingual and bi-cultural country was allowed to escalate into a bloody crisis in which thousands have died, hundreds of thousands internally displaced, with others as refugees in neighbouring Nigeria.

Did Biya have to wait for entire villages to be reduced to dust before seeking a peaceful solution? It is common knowledge that the protests started peacefully but turned violent when the state met them with force.
Biya would later extend and olive branch to the fighters, promising to give greater autonomy to the people through decentralisation. But his iron fist could not let this olive branch get to those concerned. In the same breath, he promised to crush all voices of dissent.

Hear him: “All those who have taken up arms, who perpetrate or encourage violence should be fought relentlessly and held accountable for their crimes,” before congratulating the security forces for their “bravery, determination, restraint and professionalism.”
At independence on February 11, 1961, the UN held a referendum giving Southern Cameroons the choice of joining either Nigeria or francophone Cameroon. With no option to become an independent state, they chose their francophone neighbours and together became a federal republic on October 1, 1961. But the Anglophones soon found it was not a “marriage” of equals.
Talk of an independent Ambazonia has been around since the 1980s but has gained traction in the past few months and with the many blunders of the Biya administration, many are those who may never give up the fight for their own nation. Not even a return to the 1961 status-quo makes sense anymore.
Today, a Major National Dialogue is being seen as a way to end the crisis and leave the core problems unresolved. But many diehard supporters of the regime are of the opinion that if Biya’s overture is genuine, it will have little chance of headway so long as breakaway leaders remain behind bars or in exile.
If all those in detention are freed and safety guarantees given to activists in the diaspora, then a mediated dialogue between all warring parties may save Cameroon the trouble of burying more souls in a senseless war.
But with October 1 set as the date Ambazonia symbolically declared her independence, it is not known if Cameroonian politicians will join Ambazonia commemorate the day like on October 1, 2017 when the speaker of the assembly led his peers to the reunification monument.
Gunshots have not ceased in the restive regions, with cases mo human right violations still committed by the soldiers sent to “protect” the people. The recent arrest of firebrand Muslim Scholar and critical voice of the regime, Abdul Karim Ali, has further proven the regime’s intolerance against free speech and lack of will to engage a meaningful dialogue. Would any separatist take part in the dialogue, without being arrested? Observers say no!
“This dialogue risks not only being a farce, it is looking more and more like it will do harm. Delegations from English-speaking regions, led by French-speaking governors who are representing the Anglophone population in French! Do we even remember what the Crisis is about?” Kah Walla, president of the Cameroon People’s Party, CPP, writes on Twitter.

0,Ambazonia activists unite ahead of possible negotiated settlement with Cameroon government,"September 23, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Several separatist leaders in the diaspora have hailed the creation of a single faction requesting for Swiss-led talks with the Cameroon government. The Ambazonia Coalition Team, ACT created by the uniting of over 10 different separatist factions has called the awaited national dialogue a domestic exercise stating that it will not take part.
It is however open for face-to-face talks with the Cameroon government it added. Separatist leaders have since appreciated the move, saying the ACT will act as a front for them to finally resolve the conflict.
“Morality demands that we sit on the table and talk about the necessity for justice because when there is no justice, lasting peace cannot reign,” Ebenezer Akwanga of SOCADEF said.
According to Samuel Sako of the Interim Government, “We have taken a main step to give ourselves an identity.”
The Cameroon government on its part is yet to comment on the willingness to dialogue as expressed by the separatist leaders. A number of delegations have however been sent to different countries to discuss with separatist leaders in pre-dialogue consultations.
Dr. Samuel Ikome Sako, leader of the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia Interim Government says it has become clear that only a negotiated settlement will give Ambazonia back to Ambazonians.
Dr. Samuel Ikome Sako, leader of the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia Interim Government
“This structure will be able to bring in the experts and out them in the places where they have to be in order to conduct this exercise. It is a whole project. Negotiation is a whole process. This is a whole project we are putting together and we have taken the main step to give ourselves an identity. I love the name TEAM Ambazonia. So, everyone who loves this country and who has been fighting for the liberation of Ambazonia should know that this is the moment. It has been resolved that it is only through a negotiated settlement that we are going to take our country back,” Dr Sako said.
On her part, Dr. Emmaculate Osong insists that all eight million Ambazonians must now work towards taking back their country and free themselves from oppression.
Boh Herbert
Boh Herbert of MoRISC tells the world that they are now willing to sit at the negotiation table with La Republique Du Cameroun. “We’ll beat them at the negotiating table and bring to our people a settlement that all people seeking independence have to win for the world to recognise them. So, we have set the stage, we have challenged La Republique du Cameroun to come quickly to the table.”
The SCNC has brushed aside Paul Biya’s national dialogue, stating that they are now only waiting to negotiate.
In a fiery tone, Ebenezer Akwanga of APLM/SOCADEF says they are now willing to sit with the government of La Republique du Cameroun at a neutral venue in the presence of a moderator because history, geography and morality is on their side.
Ebenezer Akwanga
“We are not looking for a temporal negative peace which is more of the presence of fear than peace itself. What we need for our people and our homeland and equally for La Republique du Cameroun and its own people is a permanent positive peace, where fear will not reign but justice, freedom, and equality will reign supreme,” Akwanga said.

With these latest developments, many have expressed fears that the expected national dialogue may not be all inclusive if these demands are not met, limiting its outcomes.

To the Donga Mantung 1 Section President of the Cameroon People Democratic Movement (CPDM) in the North West region of Cameroon, this is a welcomed initiative.
Ngala Gerald in a special program on Equinoxe television explains that a national dialogue as stated by President Paul Biya will first and foremost tackle the Anglophone crisis before addressing other issues affecting national life in Cameroon.
A point of view, Barrister Tamfu Richard militant of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement party condemns stating that no meaningful dialogue can take place with the core leaders of the Anglophone leaders still serving life jail terms in Yaounde.
To him, a presidential clemency is necessary for real dialogue to take its course.
Questioned on what he thinks about the president’s threats to crack separatist fighters who will not voluntarily lay their arms, Ngala Gerald says “…I want bloodshed to end in the anglophone regions of Cameroon. I do not accept military crackdown on the population or the fighters but let the ambazonia fighters surrender their weapons and come back to normal life”.
Questioned on why the president did not pardon those in jail, Ngala Gerald said: “the president still has the powers to pardon and could still do that in the days ahead depending on how things evolve”.
To the politician who has been a strong advocate of back to school, no one is benefiting from the unfortunate situation that has been dragging on for so long and organizing a national dialogue is a good step towards lasting peace.

0,Paul Biya’s call for dialogue is not genuine – Ambazonian leaders,"September 11, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Ring leaders of the Ambazonian movement under the Southern Cameroons Liberation Movements have ask President Paul Biya to immediately pull out his military & administration from their homeland.
They insist that president’s rare outing, Tuesday September 10, 2019 was a calculated plan by the regime and its sponsors. “We urge the international community to order Mr. Biya, his sponsors, and occupation forces to stop playing games with the lives of millions of Southern Cameroonians. As with the Soviet Union and the confederacy of Senegal and The Gambia, the failed union Mr. Biya calls the “one, and indivisible Kamerun” was declared “dead and buried” on the 1st of October 2017 and it will never be resurrected,” the release signed by ten leaders including the Ambazonian Interim government and other pressure groups said.
They said as the liberators of the people from recolonization, “we will not allow him to use such a circus to lure the international community into slumber in the belief that this heartless tyrant intends, in any genuine way, to address the identity and territorial conflict between the two Cameroons that is at the core of the war that Mr.”
“Biya declared war and is now too frightened to even recognize it,” they added.
They said the problem is way beyond marginalization of Southern Cameroonians, trade union concerns, language and bilingualism.
“This is a cause for which we will forever remain faithful and would, proudly, give our own freedom or lives. We remind Mr. Biya that we will not allow him, his regime, his sponsors and his occupation forces in Southern Cameroons to quietly slaughter, rape, maim, assassinate, kill, burn and loot with impunity. Neither will the sovereign people of Ambazonia allow the distraction that is the so-called “national dialogue” convened by Mr. Biya to misrepresent what is at stake in the Cameroons.”
Read complete statement below:
“We are horrified, though not surprised, by the callous indifference that Mr. Biya and his colonial regime continue to show in the face of what is an unfolding genocide and an illegal war of recolonization and annexation in Southern Cameroons. This war is on the verge of entering its fourth year with tens of thousands killed, over 150,000 driven into refugee camps in neighboring countries, 1.5 million internally displaced and millions more impacted.
We recognize that the tyrant of neighboring La Republique du Cameroun has arrogated to himself powers to decree the organization of any political circus, including what he described in
his address today as a “national dialogue”.
That is why, in the spirit of seeking genuine peace that is founded on justice, on international law, on United Nations-backed resolutions which grant Southern Cameroons independence, the right to self-determination and outlines a path for separation, we, hereby, reiterate our commitment to the third-party-mediated negotiations without preconditions called for and supported by the international community.
We remind the international community that the ongoing genocide in Southern Cameroons is the direct result of the botched decolonization process and that resolving it will be impossible without the restoration of the independence of Southern Cameroons.
The cancer at the heart of the genocidal war in the Cameroons is recolonization, annexation, colonial administration and illegal military occupation of Southern Cameroons by La Republique du Cameroun. The root cause is the pursuit in the 21stcentury of a crime against humanity (colonization) under an experiment that has now lasted over 100 years.
In the 44 years to 1953, that experiment failed to convert Southern Cameroonians into Nigerians. Southern Cameroons enjoyed self-government from 1954 until 1961. For 58 years since 1961, the Ahidjo-Biya regime has embarked on another failed attempt to terrorize Southern Cameroonians into becoming citizens of annexationist Cameroun.
Contrary to the claims which Mr. Biya made in his address, we remind him and his sponsors that
they have no right to take life, order the mass slaughter of those they call “dogs”, “rats”,
“roaches” and “enemies within”, and have no powers to grant pardon (to themselves or to anyone else). We will ensure that they will not enjoy any immunity or pardon for perpetrating, financing, sponsoring, committing or turning a blind eye while war crimes, crimes against humanity, violations of international law and acts bordering on genocide are perpetrated against the
sovereign people of Southern Cameroons.
We hold this truth to be self evident that the time has come for the international community to
recognize that the Biya regime is both unwilling and unable to end mass human rights violations.
As a consequence, we remind the international community of the Never Again Pledge they took following the Holocaust and encourage a break from the criminal silence that made the 1994 Rwandan Genocide possible. The time has come for the international community to evoke the Responsibility to Protect principle in order to end the genocide in Southern Cameroons.
World experts on genocide agree with us that it takes a ruthless tyrant like Mr. Biya to treat well-founded allegations of genocide as “ridiculous”.
It is shameful that Mr. Biya used his address this September 10, 2019 to express frustration with
the world that has denied him the license the Butcher of Yaounde seeks to slaughter Southern
Cameroonians with impunity. Mr. Biya is particularly irked by the fact that Southern
Cameroonians living in the Diaspora, including those who have acquired other nationalities, have
refused to look away while their family members are slaughtered. Southern Cameroonians in the
Diaspora, including those who have acquired other nationalities, along with people of goodwill
the world over, will not rest until the baby-killing regime of Paul Biya is stopped in its genocidal
tracks in Southern Cameroons.
The occupation forces and the colonial administration of Mr. Biya must withdraw
unconditionally from Southern Cameroons or must prepare to kill to the very last Southern
Cameroonian as this is the only way the colonialists from Yaounde can ever hope to take over and own our Homeland.
We salute the memory of the over 13,000 Southern Cameroonians who have been slaughtered by Biya’s genocidal forces and solemnly recommit to them and to their families that we will pursue the noble cause for which they gave their lives until restoration of independence is achieved. We recommit this day to live free, or die fighting.
We call on every Southern Cameroonian – in the Homeland or in the Diaspora – to shun any dialogue organized by Mr. Biya, his sponsors, his occupation forces and the enablers his regime continues to rely on to claim to have consent to misrule our people. We remind the world that the political will of Southern Cameroonians was freely deliberated and expressed in the two historic Declarations adopted at the end of the 1993 and 1994 All Anglophone Conferences (national dialogues) held in Buea and Bamenda respectively. The ongoing campaign for the restoration of the independence of Southern Cameroons was mandated by those 1993 and 1994 conferences at which our people took their destiny into their hands.

The international community should note that anyone claiming to be a Southern Cameroonian
who signs up to and/or participates in the dialogue called by Mr. Biya can only be doing so as a de facto hostage and prisoner of a barbaric regime that holds a gun to the head of all in order to abduct, deport, rendition, imprison, torture, “disappear”, kill and/or execute political dissidents.
The regime notably targets anyone who questions the illusionary “one, and indivisible Kamerun”
that Mr. Biya continues to claim exists, talk less of anyone who supports the independence for Southern Cameroons.
We want the world to know that no position adopted during any so-called “national dialogue”
convened by Mr. Biya and held anywhere in the Cameroons will ever be binding on the sovereign people of Southern Cameroons. No Southern Cameroonian can meet and or debate freely in a setting where they face abduction, deportation, rendition, imprisonment, torture, execution, enforced disappearances, etc. at the hands of the terrorist regime of Mr. Biya.
Locked in an existential struggle, our people now know that our survival depends on our determination to defend ourselves and our dignity as a people. It depends on ability to defend our freedom and to stop being the only country on earth that won independence before the United Nations but has been denied the right to enjoy that independence. We will settle for nothing less.
We call on the freedom-loving people of Southern Cameroons to stand ready to defend themselves and to fight to the last woman, man, boy or girl standing. We call on the 64 countries which, on the 21st of April 1961, voted in favor of the independence of Southern Cameroons at the United Nations to reaffirm their vote and to recognize that the “NO” vote cast by La Republique du Cameroun, by France and many French-speaking allies of Cameroun and France, constitutes proof of the premeditated nature of the crime of recolonization that Cameroun has been rolling out for 58 years now.
We call on our self-defense volunteers to stand ready to continue to protect their communities and to resist the genocidal forces of Mr. Biya. We call on citizens of the world who want an end to the ongoing genocide and an end to the colonial
experiment of trying to impose a different nationality on Southern Cameroonians, to join in
funding, in mobilizing and in campaigning for the restoration of the independence and
recognition of Southern Cameroons as Africa’s 55th sovereign nation”.

0,Human Rights Watch Say Military Court Slammed Hasty Verdict On Ambazonian Leaders,"September 5, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Human Rights watch in its latest report has questioned the fairness of the trial and life jail sentence slammed on Sisiku Ayuk Tabe and his fellow Ambazonian peers by the Military Court in Yaoundé on August 20, 2019.

Lewis Mudge, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch says the military Court handed down a hasty verdict and sentenced the accused without giving them any meaningful opportunity to defend themselves.

“This process has been plagued by pre-trial abuse and serious allegation of fair-trial breaches that warrants independent and impartial judicial review, which we hope will happen under appeal,” said Mudge.
Human Rights Watch regrets that the trial was conducted in French without adequate translation though the defendants were entitled to a trial in English, their mother tongue and an official language in Cameroon. The trial according to the rights group took place after serious violations of the defendants’ right, whose lawyers accused the military judge of bias and threats to arrest lawyers for raising objections.
The rights group recalls that Ayuk Tabe and Co were arrested in Nigeria and forcibly returned to Cameroon in an extra judicial transfer condemned by the United Nations Refugee Agency as violating the fundamental principle of non-refoulement.
Speaking to Human Rights Watch, Fru John Nsoh, lead counsel of the separatist leaders, said since the trial of their clients started in 2018, all hearing focused on the peripheral procedural matter, confirming the cry of the rest of the defence team that they had no prior knowledge of the evidence presented by the prosecution.
Regretting that Ayuk Tabe and Co were tried at the military tribunal against their rights, Human Rights Watch Central African Director said, Cameroonian authorities should rather focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of its Anglophone population.

Restoration forces are now asking Ban Boy why he will feel safer in the hands of the military.
“Between the La Republic military and the Restoration forces, which one does he think can better provide security to him? Or is it the military that paid him to spoil the struggle? Time will tell for he may be a secret black leg. Investigations are opened on these drivers . They are not yet free,” he said.
“The Dina-100 is burnt and not given first warning because military have been using it. We advised you to respect the shutdown period. Wasting time is over. Else be ready to dance for the drum is still playing,” our informant concluded.

Ambazonia Fighters Storm Mile 4 Nkwen In Desperate Recruitment Drive, Mark Bareta Says “It’s A Dangerous Move”","August 15, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Armed men fighting for the putative state of Ambazonia stormed Mile 4 neighbourhood in Nkwen, Bamenda III Subdivision, forcefully recruiting young men under pain of death.

Residents of Mbesi quarter say the pro-independence fighters stormed the area and demanded all the young men to join them in the struggle for the independence of Southern Cameroons or face the bullet of the Ambazonia defence force.
“Many of the young men were taken to their camps. This situation occurred at about 9pm yesterday Tuesday,” a source told Mimi Mefo info.
Another local said some of the boys who were able to escape could be seen running in tears.
One of the fleeing young men said he is the only son to his father and mother and can’t afford to live his sick mother and go for a battle which he is not sure to survive.
Many others say the struggle has turned against the people.
Enter Mark Bareta
Ambazonia activist and citizen journalist, Mark Bareta expressed shock at the recent move by some fighters to recruit young people forcefully.
His words: “I think it is very strange that this is happening. Just last week the Post Newspaper published how Denizens in Bamenda are saying how the ranks of Ambazonia fighters are increasingly with young men joining daily especially Okada riders as a result of the maltreatment meted on them by Cameroun forces.
“This is a strange phenomenon because joining the ranks of Ambazonia Fighters has always been a free will thing for those who wanted to join and defend homeland. Recall that many young persons are still out as civilians so it’s a freewill move.
“It should be noted that forcing any one to join fighting is a big risk factor because such person is not motivated. It’s not his wish as such that person becomes a big potential sell out and will sell out with the slightest move. This cannot be coming from Ambazonia groups because they know better. They always vet those who join them thus any idea of forcing people to join is a dangerous move and anti Ambazonia. 
“I am confident that someone and somebody somewhere is playing a fast one on us to tarnish the image of our forces and tell the international community that people are forced to fight. This has never happened in our revolution and all Ambazonia groups know better.”

This is the substance of a press release made public August 4 by Generals of the Ambazonia Military Forces, AMF.
The signatories include: General Ikeku, General Bishop, Kaptain Ralph, General Daddy Boy, General Danga, General Divine, General Bokilo, General Bitter Kola, General Presido and General Omega 12.
“Generals of the high command of the Ambazonia Military Forces (AMF) have followed an announcement made by one of the factions of the interim government calling for a 10-day shutdown of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia, without due consultations with the forces on the ground,” the press release reads in part.
According to the fighters, they took up arms to better the lives of the people of the North West and South West Regions and not to put them through pain and untold sufferings.
Hear them: “The Generals, following extensive discussions with the civilian population on the ground: the very people who bear the brunt of these lockdowns, have decided to declare the call null and void and hereby inform the people to go about their normal activities until further notice all over Ambazonia. It is important to note that, even the prisoners of war on whose behalf the decision was taken, have through their communication department rejected the initiative as unnecessary at this time.”

In what may well be a stern warning to those toying with the fate of the masses in the North West and South West Regions from the safety of the diaspora, the “Generals” said they took up arms to protect the people.

“We, the Ambazonia Generals on the ground have cancelled the decision. We seize this opportunity to remind our comrades in the diaspora to always seek our opinions before taking such far-reaching decisions which touch on the lives of the same people we took up arms to protect,” they said.

The last lockdown held in February 2019, taking a heavy toll on the suffering masses.

0,"Former African Heads of State & Government To Engage Cameroon Government, Ambazonia Leaders In Inclusive Dialogue","July 8, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Africa Forum, a grouping of ex-African leaders has said it will facilitate an inclusive dialogue between the government of Cameroon and those seeking the independence of a country they call Ambazonia – a geographical allusion to Cameroon’s North West and South West Regions.
In a statement dated July 2, the body chaired by former Mozambican President, Joaquim Alberto Chissano says they’ll convene a symposium on Cameroon.
One of the principal tasks of the Africa Forum (“the Forum”) of former African Heads of State and Government and other African leaders is to support the African Union as it works to guide the continent to achieve the objectives detailed in the Constitutive Act.
Statement By Africa Forum

In this context, they say, the Forum has done its best to follow the evolving but troubling situation in the Republic of Cameroon.
“In this regard it has had the privilege to convey some of its views and suggestions to His Excellency President Paul Biya of Cameroon. The Forum looks forward to further contact with President Biya on this matter,” a July 2 statement reads.
In the meantime, the Forum says it has thought it necessary that it should take all necessary steps further to inform itself about the situation in the Republic of Cameroon in as comprehensive a manner as possible.
“To achieve this objective, the Forum will therefore act to convene a Symposium on Cameroon to be held possibly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia or any other African country which will agree with the Forum to provide a venue for the Symposium,” Africa Forum writes.
The Forum says it will take steps without delay to contact a broad spectrum of the people of Cameroon and invite these to attend what the Forum intends “must be an inclusive and open dialogue.”
The Forum is convinced that the symposium will help greatly to empower it the better to assist the Government and people of Cameroon as they work to address the challenges facing this sister African country.
The Africa Forum constitutes an informal network of former African Heads of State and Government and other African leaders designed to support the implementation of the broad objectives of the African Union (AU) and its initiative, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), at national, sub-regional and regional levels.
With the specific functions of advocacy and think tanking, the Africa Forum helps harness the experience, moral authority and good offices of the former African Heads of State and Government and other African leaders with the view to assisting the advancement Africa’s social and economic development.
In the process of working towards further democratic change and transformation of the social and economic conditions in Africa, it is important to recognize that one of the critical assets that the continent has is its people and their leaders.
Most of these leaders who are vacating office have accumulated vital experience which should be used to support national, sub-regional and regional efforts towards transformation of the continent.
There is ample evidence to suggest that most of the former African Heads of State and Government and other African leaders who have left office with democratic credentials wish to continue, in their own private capacities, to serve Africa, support and complement national, sub-regional and regional efforts to end the scourge of conflicts, promote peace, security and stability as well as sustainable development of the continent.

In a statement today, the Swiss authorities say at the request of the parties, Switzerland is acting as a facilitator in the crisis in North West and South West Regions of Cameroon.
“To this end, a second preparatory meeting with various Cameroonian opposition groups took place in Switzerland between 25 and 27 June 2019.”
The statement reads: “The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), working in close partnership with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD Centre), is committed to finding a peaceful, lasting negotiated solution to the crisis in north-western and south-western Cameroon. Switzerland was tasked by a majority of the parties with facilitating an inclusive negotiation process. To this end, a second meeting with various Cameroonian opposition groups took place in Switzerland between 25 and 27 June 2019. The aim of the meeting was to prepare the future peace negotiations between the Cameroonian government and the political opposition.

“The FDFA is concerned about the continuing violence in the north-western and south-western regions of Cameroon, which is taking a heavy toll on the civilian population. Switzerland has long been committed, both at bilateral and multilateral level, to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and to promoting respect for human rights in Cameroon. Switzerland is also committed to providing humanitarian aid to the affected local population and has supported Cameroon in dealing with multilingualism.
“Facilitation is an instrument of Switzerland’s traditional good offices. In this role, Switzerland can establish contacts and provide communication channels. Switzerland’s good offices are open to all concerned parties who wish to participate in facilitation processes. Switzerland adheres to the principles of strict neutrality and discretion. In order not to jeopardise the process, the FDFA does not comment on the content of ongoing mediation efforts.”

The announcement is coming on the heels of Biya’s visit to Switzerland. Anti-Biya groups are preparing a massive protest this weekend at the Swiss intercontinental hotel, where the President, his wife and closed aides are reportedly being lodged.

Barrister Ndong Christopher, one of the defending lawyers of the interim leaders of Ambazonia speaking on behalf of the defence team, has said the outcome of today’s hearing is a significant progress in the case pitting the state and all the Ambazonian leaders involved in the January 2018 Nera arrests.
To him, for the first time, the law has been respected in the case. The Yaounde military court has adjourned the case to the 9th of July 2019.
“The judge was served a recusal notice filed and he decided to adjourn the matter pending when the decision of the recusal is handed by the Appeal Court President…” Barrister Tifuh, one of the lawyers said, adding that the fate of the ongoing case will only be known in the days ahead.
Barrister Eyambe,one of the interim leaders detained at Kondengui prison celebrated his birth day at the court with lawyers and other detainees singing birthday songs for him.
Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, President of the self proclaimed state of Ambazonia and nine other leaders have seen their case postponed several times since they were brought to Cameroon from the Federal Republic of Nigeria in January 2018.
They are facing trials on charges of terrorism, rebellion, attempts to destabilize the country, amongst others.
Political commentators say the continuous postponement of the trial is synonymous to justice denied to persons seeking the restoration of Ambazonia statehood.

And Jesus also said “And thou shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free”.
There therefore is nothing as powerful as the truth. Truth is truth’s own defence. Having been briefed over and again on the goings on in the struggle for justice, I have come to the obvious conclusion that the devil is very much at work and that no side of the fragmented struggle is spared. I have heard that all our movements, leaders and IG are now agents of La Republique; that each time people differ in views and opinions, the other side is maliciously tagged “compromised”. How do you want our people to believe that Sako, Ayaba, Akwanga, Akuroh, Boh Herbert, etc, are agents of La Republique? If all the above are compromised as everyone has tagged everyone else, then who should the people trust?
Why are our leaders all playing God? You all fabricate and churn out accounts of what God has chosen to withhold from us for the time being, and for our own sanity (many a man shall faint and not rise when God exposes some of the things we so impatiently weave yarns about); fantastical accounts of what happened at Nera for instance, have been narrated you’d think those who tell them were parties to our abduction. How’s this possible? I hold firmly that any attempt to lace the truth with lies and conspiracies will only end up putting the same truth to question. This also proves that the motives behind all such stories are everything but righteous. Remember that God who sees all things, judges us by our motives and the truth will always triumph to the shame and disgrace of conspirators. Our people, and much more the leaders should note that this struggle is about justice for Ambazonia. Can there be justice when the truth is not upheld? How can we expect the international community to uphold the truth concerning us when we are unable to uphold the same with each other? Don’t you all see that we are making ourselves an object of ridicule in the public domain? Guess who is having fun at our expense.
It is true that I have taken a firm stance against running the struggle from detention. But does it mean that everyone else in detention with me is compromised for thinking otherwise? My answer is a vehement no. Differences in view, options, and pathways do not immediately translate into treachery and “compromised”. No, not. Our resolve to see the homeland free has never wavered. I beg you all dear compatriots; while we differ, and should differ, we should desist from making such declarations and holding such positions as will make building bridges difficult or impossible. While we can not stop people from playing politics in the revolution, we all should know that it is not yet time for it. If we don’t, we should also realise that the principle of causality has not changed; same cause, same effect. Our forebears were divided in 1959-60 and landed us in this messy puddle. With all our learning, and big certificates, and titles, shall we not be better? Can we not do better? Can we not put the people first?
Dear leaders and people, can we stop here and turn our minds once more to our people? Try living on Ground Zero then you will understand; try taking refuge in the bushes then you will understand; try life as a refugee in Nigeria or in neighbouring Cameroun, then you will understand; I know some of you have been to jail before, but try it this time and you will understand; perhaps, try dying, or losing a dear one to the cause then you will know that all this ego, grandstanding and power mongering is a source of much pain and stress for our beleaguered, embattled, and endangered people. Like my brother likes to say; “Are we together?”
“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”

0,Government accuses ambazonia for killing a baby in Muyuka.,"May 22, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"“Cameroonian military is not responsible for the killing of a baby in Makanga quarter in Muyuka South West region of Cameroon”. A statement contained in a release signed by the minister of communication Wednesday May 22nd.
To Rene Emmanuel Sadi, Funi Zephania Neba, father of the child killed is an ex ambazonia boy who abandoned the course to embrace normal life.
Angered by the decision,the minister of communication explains that ambazonia boys attacked the family and kill the child as a warning to the father for betraying the course for the restoration of Ambazonia statehood.
“The man, his wife and other family members alerted earlier about the arrival of secessionists quickly ran away leaving behind their child of four months”.Rene Emmanuel Sadi explains.


To further buttress government’s position why and how the military is not responsible for the killing of the child, the release of the minister of communication states that government’s video analysis experts have established that bullets used to kill the child are local ones used by separatists and not the military.
To the government spokeperson, using real bullets of the military would have completely damage the head of the child.
As concerns a video circulating on the social media showing men in uniform committing the act, the state of Cameroon says it’s a mere artificial video editing intended to manipulate public opinion and discredit ‘republican and professional army’.
On the posture of the dead child shown in a video, government’s spoke person says, it’s a well arranged drama intended for evil against the government.
The release stresses that the mother of the child is forced against her will to make pronouncements that the military killed her child.
He applauds the professionalism of the military fighting the war and affirmed that government is determine to restore peace in the restive north west and south west regions.
Ambazonia fighters have earlier attributed the killing of the child on the Cameroonian military.
In an investigative report carried by Mimi Mefo Info Tuesday May 21st in Muyuka, the family of the dead child remained firm that military men killed baby Neba Maltha Mbuh while she was sleeping in the sitting.
The baby was shot dead on Monday the 20th of May 2019.

0,Parallel Ambazonia Fighters Are Sponsored By The Regime – Ni John Fru Ndi,"April 23, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"“If I don’t see my brother again, they themselves shall not see the light of day. This is not the Anglophone course”.
The National Chairman of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) Party in Cameroon was reacting after kidnappers took his brother and two workers into captivity.
Taken in the night of Saturday April 20th around Fru Ndi’s cattle range in Bafut Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon, Kingsley Azeh (brother to Ni John Fru Ndi) and two other workers were in search of stolen cows when they were abducted by unknown individuals. Ni John Fru Ndi has stated.
“The boys are demanding me to pay six million francs cfa or provide five guns as ransom», he adds.
He states that the kidnappers are accusing him of having commissioned elements of the rapid intervention battalion (BIR) to fight them when his residence got burnt months ago.
To Ni John Fru Ndi: “people in high government positions in Cameroon have created and are sponsoring parallel ambazonia fighters that are there to attack, kill and destroy innocent civilians”.
Provoked by the kidnapping of his brother and two workers, Ni John says the activities of the parallel Ambazonia group are contrary to the ambazonia course. “I call on the real ambazonia fighters to be focus and identify armed robbers hired by some members of government to kill the population”.
Material loses:
“In the past six months, I have lost more than one hundred cows. I had forty cows in Babanki village but today just less than eleven are left». According to Ni John Fru Ndi, the cows have been stolen by bandits who present themselves as ambazonia fighters.
He mentioned his houses set ablaze in his village by persons he suspects are fake fighters sponsored by personalities in power.
Ni John Fru Ndi judging from what he called ‘continuous atrocities’ committed against innocent population by ‘fake amba boys’ warns that famine might soon befall the troubled Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
He laments that the planting season is almost over in Bamenda and other places in the North West with women not given the possibility to cultivate crops as insecurity has become the order of the day.

0,Kah Walla Goes On The Defensive After Ambazonia Bashing,"April 21, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Kah Walla, has been bashed by Southern Cameroonians after an extract of her presentation at the Institute for African Studied, at the George Washington University was published on social media.
Many described her as a political adventurer who has never had the interest of Pro Independence Fighters and English Speaking People at heart.
Kah Wallah in an outing Sunday, April 22nd 2019, maintained that the quest for an Independent State of Ambazonia which has been at the center of the deepening armed conflict in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon is not what she stands for.
“Personally, I believe in regional autonomy or what some people call federation. However, I also believe all the different opinions have a right to exist and be expressed. We cannot build change, if we intimidate and are violent with those who have different opinion from our own…” Kah Wallah declared amid social media outburst over her statements at the George Washington University.
But a critical voice on twitter has qualified her outing as an attack on the people of Southern Cameroons, a condescending attempt at presenting them as victims of diaspora fabrications rather than regime brutality. ..”To do so on the soil millions died to give voices to protest attacks the very bastion of conscientious progressivism,” he added.



Kah Walla according to the about 45 seconds extract accused Diasporans of cultivating the spirit of lies telling at the detriment of the people.
“Those Diasporans lied to the population and told them they will be in Cameroon on October 1st.
The told them that the UN ships were in Ambas Bay…to protect the people. They made these people to come out unprotected against a government that they know for sure will shoot at the population because they have done so, time and again….And they have continued to lie… they are not taking Tibor Nagy out of context, they take his statements, and create a narrative out of it…,” Kah Walla said.
As the flare-up on twitter continued, the Director of Institute for African Studies said Kah Walla was being misquoted.
“Ms. Walla described at length the origins of the crisis, and the lawyers, teachers, civil society organizations that spearheaded the nonviolent protest movement, as well as brutal government tactics that ultimately provoked an armed response. Your clip lacks context”. Jennifer Cooke said.


In an attempt to clear the air, Kah Walla wrote:
“Fellow Cameroonians,
First I want to wish a Happy Easter to all our Christian Brothers and Sisters. Secondly, I wish to extend particular greetings to all who live in the South West and North West regions of Cameroon.
It would seem in the last 72 hours there has been quite a frenzy about a video snippet from the conference I spoke at, at the George Washington University Institute for African Studies. This frenzy has resulted in some persons in the Diaspora calling me an “enabler and declaring me an enemy of Anglophones and demanding that I should be arrested and tried”.
Thank you to all of you who have reached out to me out of concern for my safety and well-being. You are right to be concerned and I thank you for your love and affection.
Please be assured, I am serene and focused on the fight for change for Cameroon, as I have been for decades. There is absolutely no fear in my heart. No fear of visiting the South West and North West regions, which I will do upon return to Cameroon. No fear for my life.
Let me confirm some of the statements made at GWU, once again.
• There is an Anglophone problem in Cameroon which is over 60 years old.
• In the current phase of the Anglophone Crisis which erupted in October 2016, the Biya Regime holds 100% of the blame for the instigation and the escalation of the crisis. The Biya Regime refused to dialogue, refused to address fundamental problems and responded to non-violent protests with violence and killing. The Biya Regime cut off the internet for 3 months to the North West and South West. The Biya Regime radicalized the population and led to the taking up of arms by some groups.
Now let me get to the part of my comments at George Washington University which some have found controversial.
The fact that the Biya Regime is absolutely culpable, does not negate the fact that those who decided to take up arms to fight for independence misled and lied to the population from Day 1 and have continued to do so for the past 3 years.
The Biya Regime has killed Anglophones indiscriminately and committed all sorts of abomination on the population. This does not negate the fact that those who decided to take up arms have also used intimidation and violence from Day 1.
It does not negate the fact that their choice to take up arms has created a situation in the North West and South West regions which is catastrophic and untenable for the population.
In fighting the Biya Regime, we are fighting a regime which has lied to us, manipulated us, intimidated us and used corruption and violence on us for the past 37 years. It is inconceivable to me that those who want change would use the same tactics of lies, manipulation, intimidation, corruption and violence on the population while trying to bring about change.
Whether it was the intention of those who fight for the independence of the South West and North West regions or not, that is what has happened and continues to happen on the ground. We can no longer keep silent about it.
A wide variety of political opinions exist among Anglophones. At the very least, there are:
• Those who believe in an armed fight for independence
• Those who believe in independence, but not in an armed fight
• Those who believe in regional autonomy of various types = Federation
• Those who still believe in the unitary state (Yes, Anglophones who are part of the regime are still Anglophones).
Personally, I believe in regional autonomy or what some call federation. However, I also believe, all the different opinions have a right to exist and to be expressed.
We cannot build change, if we intimidate and are violent with those who have a different opinion from our own.
I strongly and openly disagree with the maintenance of the status-quo of a unitary state.
I also strongly and openly disagree with the strategy of an armed fight and have stated clearly since 2016 that I believe this strategy will endanger the lives of Anglophones and will do little to advance their rights. The facts on the ground today, have confirmed that belief.
I will not allow anyone to intimidate me or stop me from expressing my opinion. No threat of violence or arrest will affect me. I have fought one oppressor in the person of Mr. Biya and his regime for decades, I will certainly not be afraid of Facebook oppressors living thousands of miles from the people they say they are fighting for, or any other oppressors in whatever form they may come.
From October 2016 to September 2017 the fight for Anglophone rights was largely non-violent.
During that period, we counted less than 100 deaths (all these deaths could be attributed to government forces), ZERO refugees, ZERO internally displaced persons, ZERO villages burned.
The choice to take up arms gave the Biya Regime, which we all know to be violent and repressive, the foreseeable opportunity to intensify its violence.
From September 2017 to date the fight for Anglophone rights has included armed groups. During this period, we are counting at the very least 1000 dead (attributed to government, but also to armed groups), about 50,000 refugees and close to 500,000 displaced persons and thousands kidnapped. The education of an estimated 2,500,000 children is in jeopardy. The economies of the North West and South West are in shambles and fertile ground has been created for extreme violence and criminal behavior. The population lives in poverty, fear and confusion.
In my opinion, it is time to reassess the armed strategy and define new ways of fighting the Biya Regime that do not put Anglophones in the midst of violence, kidnappings, murder and general mayhem. You can agree or disagree with my opinion. What you cannot do is intimidate or threaten me.
Some have issued veiled threats to my life. I am amused. At the very least 1,000 people have died in the North West & South West. My life is not so special. If I lose it, and Cameroonians who remain behind gain freedom and better lives, you can imagine I made my peace with that many years ago.
The Biya Regime has its soldiers; those who are fighting for independence have their armed groups. I am part of that majority of Cameroonians who have no guns and no army. We will however not be intimidated or silenced by those who have arms on either side. We will speak our minds and fight for our freedom without violence.
You have killed many, and you may still kill many, including me. Know that however many you kill, there will still be others to rise up and fight for their rights, without violence and without guns.
We believe in our country, Cameroon. We believe in our future, we are on the ground fighting for our rights.
We will not be silenced”.
While some embittered Southern Cameroonians are demanding for an open apology, others have maintained, she should focus on obtaining seats at the National Assembly and in Local Councils and stop speaking on behalf of the afflicted English Speaking population.

0,Ambazonian Leaders backed Anglophone General Conference – Elie Smith,"March 30, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Postponed indefinitely last year for failure to obtain due authorization from the government of Cameroon, Conveners of the Anglophone General Conference AGC say they have used the delay to carry out intense sensitization in and out of Cameroon.
Elie Smith, Coordinator, Secretary General and official Spokesman of AGC has told Mimi Mefo Infos that leaders of the Ambazonian Movement in the diaspora are for the organization of Anglophone general Conference.
After meeting separatist leaders in America and other European countries, Elie Smith says the ball now lies in the court of the Cameroon government to issue an authorization and a security guarantee for the conference to hold.
Conveners of AGC think the forum will permit Anglophones to decide the form of state that will best respect their culture and other historical heritage.
By this, the spokesperson of the AGC distanced AGC conveners from allegations that they are having federalist tendencies.
He adds that the main convener, Christian Cardinal Tumi is committed in maintaining the neutrality of the conference that will provide a broad base representation of all classes of people from the thirteen divisions that make up the North West and the South West regions.
The venue for the conference and the date is not known but the spokesperson said Anglophone General Conference will hold in the Anglophone region.
On the issue of the posting of conflicting ideas about the struggle for the restoration of ambazonia statehood on the social media by separatist leaders in the diaspora, Elie Smith thinks the leaders are united and will support any genuine effort that will stop the killings, kidnappings, destructions and displacement of people in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
Elie Smith wave aside critics who think with the real leaders of the struggle at the Kondengui prison AGC will be useless. He is optimistic that profitable discussion can still take place with other leaders of the struggle.
Questioned on the putting in place of a North West Peace Movement by top militants of the Cameroon People Democratic Movement- CPDM, the coordinator of the Anglophone General Conference challenged the parliamentarians at the forefront of the peace movement to use the platform provided to them by the people to present the issue at the national assembly and the senate.
Elie Smith denies allegations that he has been bought over by the Yaounde regime to participate in the organization of the AGC.
To the senior journalist, he is still very vocal and critical of the regime of Paul.
He however added that, while working for the process of peace, there are certain things he is not permitted to write to the public.

0,Ambazonia Leaders Pen Emotional Letter From Kondengui Prison,"March 5, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The Ambazonia leadership currently held in detention in Yaounde for close to 14 months now have released a freedom Charter Manifesto spelling out their determination to pursue the independence of their country through a resistance that shall only end with victory.
Entitled “The Ambazonia Freedom Protocol”, the release defines the nature and value of the society that Ambazonia envisions.
In the three-page hand written document, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius and nine of his close aids in detention at the Kondengui Prison in Yaounde take nine solemn commitments as follows:
“We shall pick up and bind together the pieces of our community that have been destroyed by slavery, colonialism and neo- colonialism.
“The leaders acknowledged the fact that the Ambazonia republic has been reduced to nothing but takes the responsibility to rebuilt when the time comes.
They commit to make former Southern Cameroonians today know as Ambazonia to enjoy full independence just as other countries in the world.
The leaders apologized to women for the shameful and dehumanizing manner they have been treated all these while taking a commitment for total respect of women and girls.

They apologized for the marginalization of the minority communities in most societies throughout human history and attest their engagement to total equality and respect without qualification of all individuals.
The interim leaders equally rendered sincere apologies to those who have been maltreated and hurt physically, mentally and emotionally by tribalism and commits to total equality.
Ayuk Tabe Julius and other leaders of the interim government of the Ambazonia mentioned that they are aware of the rich advancement and quality life envisaged by the people of Ambazonia with wisdom from cultural contributions of communities and tribes.
The leadership of Ambazonia in Prison commits to build a society that cultivates peace and harmony through the respect for human rights and equitable sharing of natural resources of the land. They insist to work tirelessly to create avenue for prosperity and wellbeing of all.
They detained leaders equally commit to engage in the Pan African struggle with full resolve to stand in solidarity with all people around the world fighting for dignity against neo colonialism.
Finally, ‘the Ambazonia Freedom Protocol’ document states “we are done being balanced from one colonial chess-board to another and assert unequivocally that going forward for Ambazonia it shall be total independence or resistance forever”
The document signed on the 28th of February 2019 is the first official declaration since the incarceration of the leaders .It comes days after the verdict of Abuja federal High Court that demanded the re extradition of the leaders.

0,I Would Prefer To Be Called Ambazonians if you Don’t Cancel the Presidential Elections – SDF Lawyer Tells CC,"October 18, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"The Lead Counsel of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) party currently defending petitions filed against the October 7, 2018 Presidential Election at the Constitutional Council (CC), Barrister Francis Sama, says if the Council does not heed to his party’s request for the total cancellation of the election; it will give him enough reasons to see reasons with the Anglophone “Ambazonians’ Movement.
He was speaking this Thursday October 18, 2018 at the dock of the Constitutional Council, while presenting the epilogue of his party’s arguments.
According to Barrister Sama, if the Council does not cancel the election; it will give Anglophone Pro Independence Fighters known as “Ambazonians” legitimacy in Cameroon.
He went ahead to posit that, it was shockingly unfair, for over one million people not exercise their civic rights on October 7th due to the massive insecurity that reigns in the two English Speaking Regions.
Quizzed by the President of the Constitutional Council, Justice Clement Atangana, on whether if the Council cancelled the election and order for a re-run can SDF guarantee security within the twenty days for the re-run, Barrister Sama responded with all certainty that it will be possible within twenty days.
He urged the incumbent Head of State, Paul Biya, to use his high office and pay an appeasement visit to the Northwest and Southwest Regions so that Cameroon can continue to enjoy hear peace.
“Visit Bamenda, Buea like you visited Maroua. They are your children..they will give you a listening ear..” he said.

0,"Anglophone SDO, Handdeson Quetong, Witch-hunted, Amidst Ambazonia Piety Claims","October 12, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"One of Anglophones’ most devoted Civil Administrators, Handdeson Quetong Kongeh, currently serving as Senior Divisional Officer (SDO) for Ntem Valley, South Region, is under security radar, amidst claims he is supporting the Ambazonian secessionist movement.
Shockwaves hit many, when news broke out that the former interim Southwest Governor, and SDO for Kupe Muanenguba, is being witch-hunted by some ego-massaging individuals who are using the current crisis in the two English Speaking Regions of the Country to sabotage a longstanding reputation that the said administrator has built for himself.
Reacting to the unfounded accusations on, the Mayor of Ambam council and CPDM Section President for Ntem Valley 1, Mr Hyacinthe Mba Mbo, on Saturday, October 6, 2018 expressed total surprise. He categorised the accusations as baseless.
“Mr. Handdeson Quetong Kongeh has no connection with such an organisation. I declare this as the mayor of Ambam council and native of the area. Moreover, he has often invited me to attend sensitisation meetings with the Anglophone community here. The language he uses to sensitise the Anglophone community here is that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that Anglophones should not be manipulated,” the Mayor said.
The Municipal Authority, however, disclosed that, the SDO is being
attacked because he reduced checkpoints at Abang-Minko border market where Gabonese where complaining of harassments from the forces of law and order.
“A Gabonese citizen who came to the border market with FCFA 20.000, would finally reach the market with FCFA 8000 only
because, the rest of the money goes to individuals manning the many checkpoints between the neighbouring country and the Anbang-Minko border market. So, I asked the SDO to do something about that situation because Gabonese customers were running away and the market was dying,” Mayor Hyacinthe Mba disclosed.
The Mayor then testified that, “as the SDO
took decisions to fight the phenomenon; he was immediately targeted by some unscrupulous individuals.”
Another source close to the SDO disclosed on Friday, October 5 that, “it’s unlikely. By the time Handdeson Quetong Kongeh was SDO in Kupe Muanenguba division in the South West region for instance, he actively fought against secession. His administrative unit was never hit by ghost towns. Children went to school and the population went about its activities hitch-free until he was posted elsewhere”.
The same source reminded that, “thanks to his personal implication; the attempted coup against Equatorial Guinea on December 2017 was aborted.”
“Long before now, Quetong was Secretary General in the office of the governor of the South West region by the time there was no governor in that region and handled the region without any problem.” the same source recalled.
It should be noted that Mr Handdeson Quetong Kongeh is accused of ‘betrayal and disloyalty vis-à-vis the institutions of the republic and the person who incarnates them by his support to the Ambazonians.
The leaked cable, is contained in a recent report from the defence and security forces. The report also recommended that Handdeson Quetong Kongeh be posted out of the South Region

0,"Military burns old mother in Muamu, shoots dead two in Buea, Ambazonia Scare, and gunshots on October 1st","October 2, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Monday October 1, 2018 was relatively calm in Buea until Henry, a boy in his early 30s was shot in the chin by security forces.
Henry was driving a white vehicle when he was targeted.
He was rushed to the Buea regional hospital where he died at 3am this morning, a source at the hospital told Mimi Mefo info.

Henry was not mentally stable and is son of Mokako Bobo living in Soppo, Buea.
Still in Buea, military stormed Muamu village where they set houses on fire. An old woman who was in one of the houses died inside Mimi Mefo info has learned.
In Wokwei, an old man who was sitting in front of his door was purportedly shot dead Monday by security forces.
Buea, Kumba,Kumbo, Bafut, Bambui were rocked by gunshots Monday as Amba boys defiled administrative orders and stormed the street to observe October 1, independence day of Southern Cameroon from the United Kingdom.
Preceding October 1, administrative authorities imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew in the Northwest and Southwest regions.
According to the communique, denizens all of the two regions, were warned to remain indoors all day and night, on Sunday September 30, to Tuesday October 2. The communiques further indicated that the raison d’être for the imposed curfew, is to prevent offensive attacks from the Ambazonian fighters.
Security forces stationed themselves at every junction street, and hotspots, combat ready to react to any eventuality.
This scared away civilians who attempted to go to the streets. Denizens remained locked indoors for fear of the unknown.

Pockets of fighting were also reported in isolated locations in Buea. Reports have it that, gunmen indulge the military in an offensive attack in Sandpit, Bakweri Town, and Street II, Great Soppo. Sounds of heavy gunshots could be heard emanating from these areas.
In Bafut, Fundong, and Mbonge Ambazonian flags were raised.

Kumbo witnessed the fiercest confrontations between Security forces and pro-independence fighters.
The gunfight which lasted for hours forced frightened locals out of their homes.
“There is no way we can spend the night at home. We are all in bushes and in mountains…the military does not want to see any young man at home. They shoot and ask questions later…” a source told Mimi Mefo info last night from his hideout.
.
Amid ghost town, gunshots and tension, Brigadier General, Agha Robinson proceeded to install three soldiers to the ranks of Senior warrant officer, Warrant Officer and Sergeant.
It was a strictly military ceremony.
The Mayor of Buea was equally at the independent Square to supervise ongoing renovations at the grandstand which according to unofficial reports will receive the CPDM presidential candidate Paul Biya in the hours ahead.
It should be recalled that on Sunday October 1, 2017, several thousand people marched across the streets in the Northwest and Southwest Regions, to proclaim the restoration of the statehood of Ambazonia. Their moves to plant flags in Buea, came under severe attacks from the military, who used live bullets on the population reported to have been armed only with peace plants. Unknown figures of deaths were reported and several others injured from the military shootings.
The pro independence fighters say Buea is the capital of Ambazonia, and are doing everything they can to instill their state of rule. On the other hand, the government of Cameroon has invested a lot in arming Buea with state-of-the-art military equipment to paralyse any moves from Amba fighters.
It is October 2nd and streets are still deserted in anglophone Cameroon whereas the administrative-imposed curfew was due to expire early today.
Business premises are still closed, locals indoors for fear of the unknown.

0,Agbor Balla’s CHRDA calls on government to investigate Moja Moja’s misdeeds,"November 11, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Barrister Nkongho Felix’s Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa has called upon the government to urgently carry out investigations into acts of torture by Chief Ewume John (Moja Moja).



Moja Moja, the traditional authority of Bwasa Village in Buea, Southwest Region has been noted for harassing persons on countless basis, in the name of chasing Ambazonian fighters.

According to its release, CHRDA “… denounces in strongest terms on-going acts of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment by Chief Ewume John, also commonly known as Chief Moja Moja.”

0,"Buea: Separatist fighters kidnap man, extort 4 million FCFA from family","November 10, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Armed men believed to be separatist fighters have released a man they kidnapped 24 hours ago, in Mile 16, Buea in the restive South West Region of Cameroon.


Ikaicheck Jacob, the victim, sources say, “was kidnapped in his bar at Mile 16 Buea on Wednesday, November 9, 2022…”


The fighters are said to have stormed the neighborhood, firing gunshots to disperse locals, before carrying out the act.


“Not long after that, they visited his house and cleared about 2 million FCFA (Over 3000 US Dollars ),” the source noted, adding that the family was compelled to pay the money under duress.



This, as they threatened to burn down their home.


But the ordeal was far from over. The separatist fighters who carted the bar owner away are said to have made contact with his loved ones, demanding a ransom be paid before his release.

Helpless, the family reportedly paid 2 million FCFA for his release.

Jacob is one of many civilians to suffer at the hands of Separatists who have been fighting for an independent state called’Ambazonia’ in the North West and South West Regions of the country.


Many other kidnapped victims have been tortured and even killed by separatist fighters in other instances.

0,Anglophone Crisis: North West Population Salutes Min Paul Tasong’s Sacking As Reconstruction Plan Head,"November 5, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Soulemanu Buba


The population of Bamenda in the restive Anglophone North West Region of Cameroon where armed men are fighting to create a country they called Ambazonia have celebrated the sacking of head of the Presidential Plan for the Development and Reconstruction PPRD of the two restive regions, Paul Tasong.
The decision to replace him with Motuba Tamajong was made taken by Prime Minister Dion Ngute, 4 November 2022.

One of those who received the news of the sacking of Paul Tasong is Nde Walters who says:

“This man insulted us last time when he said if we want to see the tarring of the ring road, we should first of all stand like one man and say no to insecurity. He failed to tell us whether insecurity can also be blamed for a project that was announced in the 80’s” says Nde.

Such people, he adds, “… talk to please their God, Paul Biya. Thanks to almighty God, he has been dropped,” say Nde.

Never right man for position

To Anwi, a die-hard supporter of the Social Democratic Front, SDF political party, Paul Tasong was never the right person for that position:

“How can you bring in someone who has the mentality that it is development that is a path way to peace and not peace being a pathway to developement? He failed on the day he was appointed. They always want to bring in politics everywhere. The Gardian Post Newspaper in one of its headlines said Dion Ngute disagreed with Tasong on the impact of the Anglophone crisis on the Tea Sector, an indication that he was never fit for the job.”
There are those who still believe that the Presidential Plan for the Development and Reconstruction (PPRD) of the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon will not get it’s desired goals because the war is ongoing and beneficiaries to the project continue to die on a daily basis.

PPRD

It should be noted that the PPRD saw the light of day some years back to develop the war ravaged Anglophone regions of Cameroon where lives and properties have been damaged as a result of the ongoing Anglophone crisis.


Many say they are yet to feel the impact because the crisis keeps worsening and changing levels as the days go by.

The separatist fighter was killed yesterday Thursday November 3, 2022 along the Kumba-Buea highway by the forces of defence and security at Ediki.

The corpse of the fighter was later taken to Bicec junction, along the Commonwealth Avenue in Kumba.


“Presenting the corpse to the population in these two localities, the Senior Divisional Officer for Meme division enjoined his accomplices in the bushes to heed to the Head of State’s call to lay down their arms and join the DDR Centres in order to be reintegrated into the society,” reported FM Express Radio 91.5.

“He was arrested alive and then later shot to death which is a human rights violation,” an alternative source disclosed to MMI.

The SDO, Chamberlin Ntou’ou Ndong congratulated the forces of defence and security, indicating that they carried an act of bravery.

0,Buea: Unidentified men gun down young man,"November 4, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"A young man by name Kum Gilbert has died after being shot by unidentified men in Muea, Buea, South West Region of Cameroon.

He was shot on the evening of Thursday, November 3, 2022, while onboard his vehicle.


According to sources, “he was shot twice. He received one bullet on the chest and another of the head. He began bleeding profusely and was driven to the Buea Regional Hospital by a good samaritan.”

Reports indicate that once at the hospital, the victim was laid on the hospital bed but was denied immediate treatment as the nurses claimed they received no warrant from government officials to proceed with the treatment.


Helpless, he later gave up the ghost under the watchful eyes of the population present at the Hospital.

Many have however pointed accusing fingers at the military officials for being at the origin of the macabre act.


Meanwhile, others claim he was a victim of stray bullet during a gunshot exchange between ambazonian fighters and the military.

0,Only Yaoundé can order the release of Chelsea fan arrested in Ndu- Brigade Commander,"November 4, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Hopes for the release of diehard Chelsea fan, Israel Giyo, a young man wrongfully arrested in Ndu, North West region some weeks ago by security officers, are bleak.


Sources have it that the commander of the Ndu Gendarmerie Brigade is adamant that only Yaoundé can order the young man’s release.

Israel, a mobile money operator was arrested and detained by security forces who accused him of working with separatists abroad by receiving money in Cameroon.
Israel Giyo is a diehard fans of the Chelsea football club
They also accused him of supporting the movement, owing to his use of blue and white colours to decorate his house.


“On Tuesday, October 4 around 1pm… He was intercepted by security forces while returning from the market,” a family source narrated.
They took his ID card and phone, before searching his house.
On finding nothing, they took him to the brigade where he was held for days and then transferred to the regional capital, Bamenda.

Another close family source who asked not to be named, for fear of retribution, revealed to MMI that he is being held at the Bamenda Central Prison. “He made about three weeks in Ndu before he was transferred to Bamenda”.


Family, pregnant wife in distress

Israel’s family has been left in great distress and uncertainty, since his arrest, given that he was the breadwinner. His wife is eight months and a week pregnant.


“It is not easy with her. She is worried. She has been inconsolable ever since and was taken to the hospital by her mother recently as the pregnancy is too heavy for her already,” the family source narrates.

The situation is expected to get worse as she will put to birth in a few days and would need all the support she can get from her partner.

Israel Giyo at work
The bed of Israel Giyo is covered with Chelsea colours (blue and white) which happen to be the same colour of the Separatists’ flag. (They are fighting for an independent state called’Ambazonia’ in Anglophone Cameroon).
Between the devil and deep blue sea

Israel’s current predicament is heightened by his sad story of being a victim of both sides of the Anglophone crisis.


Israel has also been a victim of separatist fighters who had been kidnapped a number of times and accused of working with government Security forces.

“They took him to their camp where they detained him for a while”, the family source narrates.


Yet, Israel remained determined to stay back and not leave Ndu, unlike many others that have fled the armed conflict.

His desire to stay back and develop his home has made him one of the thousands of victims of the armed conflict now languishing behind bars.

“If Yaounde does not call there is nothing we can do,” the local security authorities told Israel’s close family members.


Israel’s case further sheds light on the complex nature of the hyper-centralisation of power in Cameroon. The decision to detain Israel without due process was taken locally, without consultation with Yaounde, but the local authorities now claim that Yaounde must be involved in providing a solution.
This is a complex relationship that has been at the heart of the Anglophone crisis and continues to fuel the conflict and multiply the injustices meted out on the population.

0,Ndu: Arrested Mobile money operator transferred to Bamenda prison despite appeals for his release,"October 31, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The woes of Israel Giyo, a mobile money vendor arrested on October 6, 2022 in Ndu, North West region, are far from over.
Security forces had accused him of receiving money from abroad to give to separatists fighting for an independent state called ‘Ambazonia’ back home.
However, a new development appears to have put his release in more jeopardy.
His love for football is said to have been added into the mix. Being a fan of Chelsea football club, he dressed his home in the flag colors of the club, right up to his bedsheets. (Blue and white).
Unfortunately, the same colors also pass for the flag of separatist fighters. Anyone caught with those colours are either arrested by security forces or taken for questioning.
“Israel Giyo has now been transferred to Bamenda prison,” a reliable source close to the family told MMI.
Israel, in his early 30s, now joins thousands of other men locked up in jails across Cameroon in connection with the Anglophone crisis which began in 2016.
With many being of working age, their families and communities continue to lose from their absence as the government and separatists fail to reach an adequate settlement to end the war.

0,"Kidnappers of Mamfe Priests & others, reduce initial ransom demand to 25 million FCFA","October 22, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana

The release of five Mamfe Priests and other church servants has been conditioned on the payment of a ransom of 25million CFA, MMI has gathered.


Amongst them are five priests, one Reverend Sister and three domestic servants.

They were kidnapped on September 16, 2022 in Nchang village, Manyu Division of the South West Region.

The church from which they were kidnapped was reduced to arshes by the kidnappers.

A source close to one of the kidnapped priests told MMI that the kidnappers had initially demanded for a ransom of 60 million FCFA.

The family source said negotiations were made before the sum dropped to 25 million FCFA.


“They were demanding 60 Million, then 30 million and that if they are considering something lower, it should be 25 Million FCFA”, the source said.

This development is coming few days after a video was released showing the kidnapped persons in deplorable living conditions.

One of the priests in the circulated video pleaded with Church authorities to heed to demand of the abductors for them to regain freedom.


“So far it has not been easy. If you look at us you will see our faces are very unhappy” the priest said.

“It is quite difficult and we are only begging my Lord that you do everything possible to get us out of here. It is a matter of do or die” the Rev. pleaded

Their health situations are reportedly in bad state with no medical attention.

“I have been very sick and my brothers too are not feeling fine at all. My lord listen to these boys and whatever they ask of you.” he further implored.


The kidnap of the priests and attach on church structures has received widespread condemnation. One of the pro-separatists who was unhappy with the treatment of the priests begged for them to be released:

“What type of independence are we fighting for and humiliating men of God in this way. Who will pray for us? This is totally unacceptable my people. Please I’m on my knees release them. I can stop crying after watching them pleading for their lives. If they did anything wrong please forgive and release them please” – they wrote in an Ambazonian forum.

This is not the first time that the clergy and the church has been attacked in the deteriorating conflict that is crippling the Anglophone regions of Cameroon. The late Christian Cardinal Tumi was also a victim of kidnapping by separatist fighters, shortly before his death.

0,Jailed Separatist leader Ayuk Tabe reiterates ‘independence or resistance forever’,"October 2, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana

Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, jailed leader of the Self -proclaimed state of Ambazonia has called for continued resistance if independence is not granted.

In a message released Saturday October 1,2022 Mr Ayuk serving a life jail term in Cameroon’s capital Yaounde said the independence struggle is a reality.

October 1 is commemorated as independence day by activists fronting for the creation of separate English state from dominant French speaking Republic of Cameroun.

In a message from within the prison walls to mark this year’s celebration Mr Ayuk Tabe sounded optimistic.

“We have stood firm.We continue to walk tall and straight even as we fight to once and forever restore the independence of our beloved nation, Ambazonia”, said the jailed separatist leader recalling that, “For more than half a century our parents before us and we until a few years ago lived a deliberate lie in a ‘come we stay’ relationship that was faking for the real deal”.

“We know today that we can not tell our children anything about their destinies that will not be a lie” he went on.

Addressing naysayers of Ambazonia project, the computer engineer turned separatist leader said, “From the onset , naysayers said we fold and submit in subservience.They said that our enterprise to defend our families and our land from a raging maniacal adversary was naive and impossible”

Looking at the road covered, the jailed leader added that “You have proven everyone of them dead wrong.In this war, our collective wounds and sacrifices remind us of the huge price we must pay for our liberties”

Acknowledging the human and material loss so far, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, noted that the quest for freedom has never been an easy one.

“Freedom and liberty everywhere in every age and time have been gotten only by sweat, tears, blood and loss of human lives by those few people brave enough to dare to be liberated and free” Sisiku noted adding that, “The people of Ambazonia shall forever be remembered for the magnificence of courage,we have to endure to liberate ourselves”

According to him, it has been regrets all along with the kind of treatment metted the people he claim to fight for their liberation.
“Since 1961, even our parents ingratiated themselves to la Republique du Cameroun,all we have received in return is shame, humiliation, insult, abuse, torture and summary executions ” the separatist leader went on.

With all these he said, it was time to fight and victory is on their side.

“The time came and we as a people have had to sink or to swim.We have had lower as cowards or to fight.As it is our right,we choose to fight. We are fighting most valiantly,beyond every expectations” Sisiku boasted

Believing that independence is near he said, “We thank God all mighty we are winning too.Ambazonia is a reality”

He never the less wished his comrades well as they celebrate their independence day

“I join with you to celebrate today as our children shall celebrate into perpetuity every October 1,this Wonderful independence day.May God all mighty continue to bless you.May God bless Ambazonia” Sisiku said said with optimism.

Separatist Fighters in Bali Nyonga under the canopy of the Buffalos of Bali Nyonga, one of the epicenters in the war troubling the two Anglophone regions of Cameroon have reiterated their determination to build a solid wall against Kidnapping for ransom, extortion amongst others.

During activities to mark what they call their independence day on October 1, 2022 – the day former British Southern Cameroons got her independence by joining the Republic of French Cameroon, the Buffalos say there will be no hiding place for rogue fighters whose aim is not to defend their people but enrich themselves through Kidnappings for ransom, amongst others.
“Any fighter doing what is not for the struggle including Kidnapping for ransom, asking for support shall be dealt with. We are fighting for the Ambazonia flag and anyone going astray will be strengthened” said the spokesperson of the Buffalos in a video shot in Bali.

The fighters also marched to the Ntafoang Square from the Market as they celebrated the day.

0,"Separatist fighters put up October 1 display in Lebialem, send message of comfort to refugees","October 1, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Separatist fighters in an undisclosed locality in Lebialem Division of the South West region have released a video in commemoration of October 1, Independence Day of British Southern Cameroons.

In the video, armed men are seen brandishing guns and Ambazonia flags as a crowd of mostly women and kids watches on.

Talking to the camera, a man referring to himself as King Die Man called on refugees and victims of the Anglophone crisis to not lose hope.

“We are fighting and we will never forget you people. ALA which is led by me, King Die Man will never forget you people. We are with you until Buea,” he stated.

The move comes as defiance to government which has for years now, tried to mute the separatist movement through the use of arms.

Soldiers have in the past, effected multiple crackdowns on Anglophone communities on October 1, seeking to stop any independence commemorations.

0,Anglophone Crisis: Administrative officials in Mezam ban public gatherings as October 1 nears,"September 28, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By David Atangana
Authorities of Division in the restive North West region have banned public gatherings.
MMI has gathered that the decision emerged in the wake of October 1, 2022.
October 1st is celebrated every year by Separatist fighters as the independence day of the self-styled state called Ambazonia.
Separatists have been fighting for an independent state of Ambazonia since 2016. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives and millions displaced.
In a prefectoral order signed by the Senior Divisional Officer of Mezam on Tuesday September 27, 2022, all public manifestations are prohibited ’till further notice.’
“That with effect from the date of signature of this order, undeclared meetings and manifestations in Mezam division are hereby prohibited till further notice,” the order signed by Simon Emile Mooh, SDO for Mezam reads.
The order obliging administrative collaborators to implement, threatened sanctions against those who violate.
“That any person or group of persons who violate the provisions of the present order shall be punished in accordance with the rules and regulations in force,” a section of the prefectoral order further reads.
It is likely that order administrative units in the region will follow suits in the days or hours ahead.
It should however be recalled that, government had before the advent the Anglophone crisis 2016, been skeptical of October 1 following sustained attempts by activists to declare a separate state from the rest of the country.
The day is however, defiantly celebrated by armed separatists.
Proponents and activists of Ambazonia movement have so far been calling it’s celebrations as a symbol in their fight for independence.

A field pastor alongside four medical personnel of the hospital situated in the North West Region are reported to have been kidnapped by Ambazonian fighters.


They were kidnapped after being accused of collaboration with military forces.

According to CNA, those kidnapped include, “Rev. Shey John (Nso Field Pastor), Ma Mbiydzenyuy Margaret (Nurse), Njolai Lawrence (surgical technician), Fai Peter (security guard) and Godlove Selamo (biker for health).”

The kidnap comes shortly after three other medical staff of the same hospital were arrested by the military for conspiring with Ambazonian fighters.
The current situation puts the hospital in a fix, as its staff are being persecuted from both ends for doing their job. Human rights groups have decried acts by the warring parties to compromise the neutrality of medical facilities and churches.

However, institutions that chose to stand their ground and offer health care to all in need continue to find themselves being persecuted.

0,One injured as separatist fighters clash in Bali over kidnapped civilian,"September 24, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Soulemanu Buba

A separatist Fighters operating under the banner of the Ambazonia Defense Force ADF of Ayaba Cho Lucas has been injured in the leg.

He was shot in a standoff between his team and another separatist faction, the Buffalos of Bali Nyonga. This was after the Buffalos intercepted the ADF team in an active kidnapping.


The kidnappers were enroute to Batibo from Bali in Momo Division with a man they kidnapped at the Ntahturu Park neighborhood in Bamenda.


Reports say the man had just arrived Bamenda from Yaounde to bury his father when he was forcefully taken away at gun point Thursday September 21, 2022.

As the bike descended the hill after the market in Bali, the were asked to stop after the fighters from Bali who suspected foul play. After interrogating the men, one of them who tried to fight back received a bullet in the leg.

Sources in Bali say the victim was set free and his return to Bamenda facilitated by the fighters in Bali.

Capo Daniel, spokesperson of the ADF has in a video online condemned the fighters in Bali saying amongst others that intercepting his boys is an unacceptable action.

“He is a millionaire in Yaounde and has been contacted several times to support the struggle but failed. He was not kidnapped but invited to our mother base accompanied by two soldiers for a talk.They should be released immediately,” said Capo Daniel of the victim.


Inhabitants of Bali say kidnapping for ransom is a rare happening in that part of the crisis hit region and that they they can’t even remember when it last happened.


This is however not the first time the Buffalos of Bali are standing against ADF. Some weeks back, members of ADF stormed the Ntafoang Square in Bali and tried imposing a lock down operation.

News got to the fighters from Bali who in their numbers landed at the scene forcing the ADF members to retreat.

The government of Cameroon has rejected a third party mediation to resolve the armed separatist conflict in Cameroon’s Anglophone Regions.


The chief envoy on the Swiss-Led Mediation, Ambassador Gunther Bachler informed the Ambazonia Coalition Team (ACT) that it is ending its efforts toward brokering peace in the nearly six-year-long war in Southern Cameroons.


The position of the government comes three years after the process was initiated with both parties allegedly committed to it.


President Paul Biya reportedly told the President of Swiss confederation Ignazio Cassis in a conversation that the current military option ‘will do.’


A coalition of separatist groups-Ambazonia Coalition Team, made the revelation after a meeting with the Swiss envoy September 13, 2022.


“We the Southern Cameroonian Liberation Movement, have been briefed of the choice made at the highest level by Cameroon to prioritize war and to seek military victory over a negotiated settlement,” a statement from ACT said.


The statement further revealed that “Yaounde has told the Swiss government that they are not interested at this moment in third party mediation.”


While snubbing any negotiations over war with separatists, the government of Cameroon reportedly called on the Swiss government to rather support the major national dialogue held in Yaounde in 2019.

“The Biya regime has invited the Swiss to stay engaged, notably seeking their good offices to support Cameroun’s major national dialogue which Yaounde claims can resolve the ongoing genocidal violence in The Cameroons,” the separatists coalition continued adding that: “The so called Grand National Dialogue is a sham and no genuine Southern Cameroonian will participate in it.”


Noting that the position of Cameroun was obvious, ACT said “Team Ambazonia which was always aware of Cameroun’s bad faith even when we signed into mediation leading to negotiations without preconditions has taken note of Cameroun’s resolve to persist in it’s genocide and doomed colonial adventure in Southern Cameroons.”


Expressing disappointment over government’s position, separatists have called on the international community supporting the process to “take appropriate against Cameroun for it’s atrocity crimes.”


The UN, UK, Canada, Germany, Belgium, EU and others that have been supportive of process are yet to react.


This latest development comes less than two weeks after Cameroon deployed special forces to the restive Anglophone regions to crush armed separatists whom she consider as terrorists.


Human rights reports say the conflict has led to the death of atleast 3,500 people, 712,000 internally displaced, 80,000 refugees, 2.2million in need of humanitarian aid with hundreds of villages including hospitals and schools burnt down.

0,"Separatist activist, Eric Tataw switches position on CDC, back to school, ghost towns…","September 13, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Ambazonian activist, Eric Tataw, also referred to as ‘Garri Master’ has urged workers of the Cameroon Development Cooperation to return to work.

He made the surprising declaration in an exclusive interview with The Guardian Post newspaper.

This comes following years of sustained campaign from him and other separatists for attacks to be carried out on workers of the CDC company who snobbed orders to abstain from work.


He was also nicknamed Garri Master as he made multiple calls for separatist fighters to ‘Garri” persons defying his orders for ghost towns and school boycott. Many pro government activists had called for him and others to be arrested and tried for multiple crimes and human rights violations.
After a temporary hiatus from his online activities, he has resurfaced. As it stands, Eric Tataw, aside from being a journalist, is now owner of company that imports CDC bananas and palm oil.

When requested to reconcile both gestures, Eric Tataw said, “the first thing is that CDC is not owned by the Cameroonian government… As a citizen of Southern Cameroons, CDC is in my land in the South West region. I have every right to import what CDC produces at this point because strategies change.”


He added, “I am for CDC and I will continue to import its produce to use proceeds for things that are important to me; especially charity.”

Eric Tataw equally went further to encourage the resumption of schools in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon. He said,” The students should go back to school. Towns in Anglophone Cameroon should be fully functional and booming with business activities.”

According to Eric Tataw, the imposition of lockdowns by the separatist fighters in the Anglophone regions is rather punishing the population. He reiterated that lockdowns should be limited to Mondays and significant days like February 11 and May 20.


“No lockdowns should exist anymore, but the Monday ghost towns should continue. This is because it is the soul of the revolution. We don’t need one-month or even one-week lockdowns, but we can have lockdowns on days of events that are giving La Republique du Cameroun significance. This includes 11 February and 20th May, ” insisted Eric Tataw.

Many have however been left speechless following the sudden change in position by the US-based activist, as regards the Anglophone crisis.

Some believe his recent U-turn is due to the benefits he accrues from his new found business.

Some believe his recent U-turn is due to the benefits he accrues from his business.
Image cleansing

Tataw has also been accused of orchestrating kidnapping of civilians in exchange for ransom. Many rights groups have pressed for he and other separatist extremists to face the law for ordering the amputation, abduction and torture of many in their separatist cause.

His latest utterances are seen by many now as an attempt to cleanse his image after causing untold pain and suffering to others and remaining adamant to apologize.
“Any child you see going to school, catch them and give them 25 strokes of the cane on their buttocks… When you catch a school principal, keep them until the end of the war,” he had instructed separatist fighters in one of his multiple messages filled with threats towards those going to school.

His U-turn comes after an International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim A. A. Khan warned against crimes committed against academic institutions and learners.

The ICC, the Prosecutor noted, “will work with all partners to seek accountability for such acts.”

0,"Bamenda: Soldiers suspected of staging kidnap of school principal, staff","September 6, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana

So many questions are beginning to pop up following the kidnap and subsequent release of the principal and other staff of GBHS Atiela-Nkwen, Bamenda.

They were reportedly kidnapped and exploited some days back before being released by their captors.


Report says the kidnapped who were picked up from the school premises included the principal, two vice principals,one discipline master and one teacher.

MMI gathered that this happened under the nose of government soldiers guarding the institution 24/7.

A source who opted not to be named told MMI that from all indications, the kidnap was not done by Separatists Ambazonia fighters as many were made to believe.

“But they aren’t ambas. They were armed robbers who wanted money,” the source said.

“You won’t imagine six gendarmes were in school and they took the teachers without them hearing” the source wondered.

The alleged kidnappers reportedly entered the campus in broad day light with military on guard.

“At about 1 pm, three armed boys drove to school. The administrative block is outside the gate” the source went further, adding that “none of the six gendarmes on guard were on alert”.

“The boys didn’t fire but just moved and took everybody hostage. They collected all belongings and ransacked the office,” the source narrated, revealing that “the boys were in the block for 10mins”.


The abductees were reportedly taken away in a car belonging to one of the teachers.

“They took us to the bush, collected all money from our mobile money accounts and the cash on us”, one victims lamented

“I am surprised they broke the windscreen of the car we were taken into and it made a very loud sound but the military claimed the didn’t hear”, one of the victims lamented.


It should be noted that it is not the first time armed men have entered GBHS Atiela whisking staff away despite ‘tight security’

Last year, the learning institution witnessed same scenario. Many are wondering if the soldiers stationed there are complicit in the recurrent act of putting the lives of teachers at stake.

At least three people have been killed and houses burnt in Difenda Balue, a village in Dikome Balue subdivision in Ndian division of the restive South West region of Cameroon, MMI has gathered.

Those killed, reports say included, Nelson Mindako, Chairman of Difenda Balue traditional council, a certain Sakwe, and an unidentified young man popularly known as Chopper Chopper.


Locals say, they were killed by soldiers loyal to the government of Cameroon who stormed the village Friday August 26, 2022 in a raid. Theyr motive, reports say, was allegedly to fish separatist Ambazonia fighters.

“Information reached the military that, an Amba general and colleagues have been dwelling in Difenda Balue,” a local told MMI.


“… About 17 trucks of army invaded the area and killed three youths- Sakwe and Chopper Chopper including the village head council, Nelson Mindako,” the source added.

It is not known why the three people were killed.

The military reportedly left the village with houses torched, promising to come back.

“They burnt down two houses and promised to come back again,” the source furthered.

0,"Cameroon’s Bamenda, where only the coffin trade is booming","August 23, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Randy Joe Sa’ah
Once a thriving city in Cameroon, Bamenda has been ripped of its soul by the five-year war between English-speaking secessionists and the mainly French-speaking government.
Bamenda is all but dead. Only the coffin trade is booming. Bodies are dumped regularly all over the city – in mortuaries, on streets and in rivers.
Council workers pick them up and give them a pauper’s burial.
“It is a blessing to be buried at all, let alone by family and friends,” says a cemetery worker as he comes to pick up 10 cheap coffins from a funeral parlour.
Demand has dropped for the once-popular elaborately designed coffins – shaped like bibles, cars or beer bottles to reflect the lifestyle, interests or last wishes of the dead.
“Coffins that used to sell for a million CFA francs [about $1,500, £1,270] are out of commission because nobody can afford them. Most people can only afford coffins for 50,000 CFA francs,” says an attendee at a funeral parlour.
The regular funerals for young men and boys are a brutal reminder of the conflict in Cameroon’s English-speaking regions of North-West and South-West.
In just five years, that conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, while forcing more than one million to flee to French-speaking areas and a further 80,000 to take refuge in next-door Nigeria.
The war has its roots in grievances that date back to the end of colonialism, when British-controlled territory was unified with French areas to create what is now Cameroon.
Many English-speaking Cameroonians have felt marginalised ever since and have opposed what they see as attempts by the government – dominated by the French-speaking majority – to force them to give up their way of life, including their language, history and education and legal systems.
Tensions boiled over in 2016 when tens of thousands of people in Bamenda and other English-speaking areas embarked on a series of protests against the use of French in their schools and courts, as well as the failure to publish government documents in English, even though it is an official language.
With the government ordering the security forces to crackdown on the protests rather than entering into talks to resolve their grievances, young men took up arms the following year to demand the independent state of Ambazonia, as they call the two English-speaking regions.
Now, military vehicles – including those with mounted machine-guns – constantly criss-cross Bamenda.
Residents say soldiers raid homes, make arrests, burn markets and even display the bodies of their victims, including commanders of militias, at major intersections to warn residents against joining the separatist fighters.
Government forces have also suffered heavy losses in the conflict, with the bodies of fallen soldiers removed from the military’s mortuary in the capital, Yaoundé, every Thursday and Friday.
Widows wail in front of the long lines of coffins draped in the Cameroonian flag, before the soldiers are buried amid the pomp and ceremony that mark military funerals.
Separatist fighters have also gained notoriety for atrocities against civilians, including beheadings and the torturing of women whom they denounce for “betraying the struggle”, calling them “black legs” – a term regularly bandied about now.
They circulate videos of these atrocities to warn people of the punishment they face if they are suspected of colluding with the security forces.
On Mondays, Bamenda becomes a “ghost town” with the roads empty and markets closed – part of a civil economic disobedience campaign dating back to before the armed struggle. These days, residents who dare ignore the lockdown order are either shot dead or see their shops go up in smoke.
The military and police also disappear from the streets, so that they do not become soft targets for separatists fighters who have a strong presence in the city.
The separatists even ordered the closure of all schools four years ago as part of their campaign. A few have bravely remain open, but children do not dare wear uniforms.
The military enforces a curfew virtually every night in the city, resulting in many of its restaurants, bars and clubs – once reputed to be the best in Cameroon – going out of business, not helped by the now-erratic electricity supply.
“The constant frying of popcorn has driven everybody away,” says a waitress using a metaphor to describe the never-ending sound of gunfire.
She says it has also prevented those who live abroad from coming home. Known as “bushfallers” – a Pidgin term for hunters (in this case seeking greener pastures) – those in the diaspora were responsible for Bamenda’s economic heartbeat, sending back money to invest in the once-mushrooming building trade and coming back at Christmas to share their largesse.
But the authorities accused them of bankrolling the Anglophone rebellion. Visiting returnees soon found themselves arrested – some are now in the maximum security prisons of Yaoundé or Douala – while others simply disappeared. Bushfallers’ money has dried up and none of them now visit.
Long-time resident Peter Shang, who once loved life in the city, says people now take one day at a time: “Life is a lottery. Too many things remind you about untimely death. You talk to someone today and tomorrow they are gone.”
For Marie Clair Bisu, there is a silver lining – she sees more of her husband, because he gets home before curfew.
“He has now discovered his children. This is a man who used to come back late sometimes drunk and would just head to bed. Now he can play with the kids and check their books. This conflict has reunited us,” she says.
“The only problem is that the gunshots always spoil our nights.”
And after a night of shooting, residents have to make several calls and listen out for traffic to check the situation is safe before venturing out. Even so, gunfire has become so common in Bamenda during the day that people no longer immediately flee at the sound.
“What would we eat if we keep running? I have children to feed,” a vegetable seller says.
“We simply dive for cover and get back to business when the gunshots stop.”
Another woman says her child has got so used to the sound of gunfire that she knows who is shooting.
“My daughter is seven and she can tell whether the sounds are from machine guns of the army or the AK-47 rifles of ‘The Boys’,” she says, referring to the separatist fighters.
Some nuns who I meet by a road in the city centre say they are waiting for a taxi to go to the Abangoh Orphanage.
The war has seen an explosion in unwanted teenage pregnancies, they say – with girls who have been forced to flee their homes becoming victims of sexual violence and exploitation by both sides. One angrily says: “Rape as a weapon of war is despicable.”
At every corner, there is evidence that the very fabric of this once-glitzy city, where piles of billowing rubbish now tumble, has been permeated by the stench and misery of what many here regard as an unnecessary war.

The town of Buea, Capital of the restive South West region Monday August 15, 2022 witnessed an unusual scenario staged by armed separatists Ambazonia fighters and a certain Chief Moja Moja who doubles as a soldier.
Separatists fighters under the Command of ‘General’ Sagat, stormed the streets of Buea burning down a vehicle for violating the regular Monday ghost town imposed by separatists since 2017.
“………this is Buea Central Market. The ekelebes (referring to government soldiers) have escaped,” said an armed separatist in a viral video.
“As from today, anybody seen in a vehicle on a ghost town day in Buea will be shot and killed be it who,” the Separatist fighter threatened, before setting a bus on fire for violating their lockdown rules.
Shortly after the incident, Chief Moja Moja, a local chief in the company of three others holding the Cameroon flag, appeared at the scene in a video claiming that the fighters disappeared upon his arrival to face them.
“You people are lucky. You disappeared after hearing that I was coming. I would have dealt with you people” said Moja Moja challenging that, “if this is Ambaland you people should come.”
“We stand for one and indivisible Cameroon,” he and his friends emphasized.
The said chief is known for harassing young men and pregnant women on the streets of Buea in the name of fighting separatist fighters.
Moja Moja has severally appeared on videos threatening to deal with Separatist fighters, but has never been seen in active combat on the field.
The said chief who passes around for a soldier was recently dragged to court by a group of human rights lawyers for taking state laws into his hands.
His case is still under review at the military tribunal in Yaounde, the human rights lawyers told MMI.

0,Anglophone Crisis: Multiple soldiers die in clashes with Separatists in Ndop,"August 12, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana
Soldiers fighting separatists In Ndop have recorded multiple fatalities following fresh gun battles with separatists Ambazonia fighters in Bamessing-Ndop, Ngoketunja division of the restive North West region, MMI has gathered.
Reports on the ground have it that the government soldiers equally lost two armoured vehicles in the attack, Wednesday.
The incident is reported to have occured Wednesday August 9, 2022.
“Pray for Ngoketunja. It is hot here. All patients have been discharged from Ndop hospital,” a local told MMI, adding that: “the whole hospital is owned by the military.”
“Several military people have been killed with two of their armoured cars captured or destroyed in Bamessing under Sabga hill,” the local who opted not to be named said.
According to the source, “helicopters were seen hovering around picking military corpses that could be seen.”
“Other corpses were missing, while others were dumped at the Ndop hospital mortuary,” the source continued.
A viral audio spread by separatists confirmed that several soldiers were killed with serveral others wounded.
These allegations could not be independently confirmed by MMI.
The government of Cameroon has so far not reacted to the claims that she lost soldiers and two armoured vehicles to separatists in Ndop
However, rare amateur footages obtained by MMI show two death soldiers by the roadside surrounded by colleagues while some wounded are seen being brought to a health facility.

0,Not every Anglophone is a separatist — Jovi cries out,"August 9, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Ndukong Godlove aka Jovi Lemonstre has remarked that Anglophones in Cameroon are often all considered to be separatists, without any forethought.

Jovi in a series of posts early today, decried the phenomenon, stating that “Not everyone living in that region is part of the group.”

Citing a 2015 dinner with Francophone acquaintances, he said he shared with them news of a relative shot in the head. What followed, he said, was an expression of joy, with one of the ladies actually calling the said relative, an Ambazonian.


“She told me that he got what he deserved and she said she must have been an Ambazonian,” Jovi stated.


He went on: “I am advising anyone who has talent and a promising career from my region to go to another country especially if you are still young [or] You will waste your youthful years like I almost did with mine.”


The Anglophone Crisis which started in 2016 morphed into an armed conflict in 2017, and has forced hundreds of thousands of English-speaking Cameroonians into the French parts of the country.


There have been testimonies of how, some Anglophones in French regions, are not feeling at home.

Joseph, according to a family source, was suspected of being a teacher – an accusation family sources have debunked.
“He was picked up on Sunday morning in our house in Buabua, he is just a farmer,” a family source told MMI.
The Perpetrators of the act are reportedly demanding huge sums in ransom to free the captives.
“And this people are asking him 1.5million as ransom,” the family source who opted not to be named, revealed.

One of the Honorable members of Parliament from Ngoketunjia Divison of the war-ravaged North West Region says armed robbers are responsible for the killings and kidnapping of civilians in the two Anglophone regions.
The Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement, CPDM party MP made the revelation last Thursday, July 28, 2022, during the seventh session of the North West Regional Assembly.
“Let me tell you, they killed senators, these are not Ambas, these are armed robbers who are pretending to be Amba fighters. There are no armed robbers in Yaounde, Douala, and the other big cities of Cameroon. They have all moved to the North West and South West regions. We must do everything to eliminate these dangerous elements so that we can develop our communities,” Njingum Musa told the North West Regional Assembly.
The Parliamentarian’s outing came at a time when Separatists who are fighting to restore an independent state called “Ambazonia” have come under increasing fire for the massive killing of civilians.
Njingum Musa’s declarations, however, contradicts some credible human rights organisations that have also documented civilian killings carried out by separatist fighters as well as government forces.
They say many more unarmed civilians will continue to die needlessly as the violence continues unchecked.

0,Anglophone regions on lockdown as Macron visits Yaounde,"July 26, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana

Some major towns in the English speaking Northwest and Southwest regions are in lockdown.

The Sako-led Interim Government of Ambazonia is reported to have called the lockdown in what they call,’a protest’ against the visit of French president Emmanuel Macron to Yaounde-nations political Capital.

Mr Emmanuel Macron is on an official visit to Cameroon since July 25 and is expected to end on July 27th, 2022.

Images from Bamenda and Buea show empty streets with most businesses closed.

Some inhabitants consider the lockdown as irrational given that Mr Macron is visiting Yaounde and not the North West and South West regions.


“What is the use of a lockdown in Bamenda for example when Macron is in Yaounde and will likely not come this way” a Bamenda local told MMI.

“Let those calling for this lockdown know we are tired of this kind of suffering they are giving us all the time” another inhabitant said.

It should be noted that separatists have been using lockdowns as means to prove control of the North West and South west regions.

0,"The Colbert Factor: Letter to Emmanuel Macron, French President","July 25, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Your Excellency; welcome to Cameroon, ‘land of promise’ and ‘land of glory’; after winning your second and last mandate as President of France, Cameroon’s (former) colonial master. I know you come as a master who wants to see first-hand how his (former) estate is faring. No gainsaying the fact.
Your decision to visit Cameroon this Monday, July 25, 2022, may seem innocent to many, but by God’s design, it’s providential. July 25, in the church’s year, his the feast day of St. James, one of the two sons of Zebedee and the first matrye of the 12 apostles. James is famous in the Bible because his mother, wife of Zebedee, who had great influence on Jesus went kneeling infront of Jesus, requesting that he commands that his two sons, James and John, take the first position in Heaven: one on his left and one on his right. Although Jesus disappointed her by saying that her sons may only have the privilege of sharing in his suffering, the decision on who goes to Heaven is that of his father, not his.
The announcement of your visit to Cameroon today creates the same anxiety and expectation Zebedee’s wife and children had as Jesus was approaching the end of his mission on earth. Just as they thought Jesus could reserve the two privileged positions for them in Heaven many a Cameroonian in general and citizens of native West Cameroon in particular, look up to your visit and meeting with Cameroon’s long-serving President, as a moment of clarity. Just like Jesus used the opportunity of Zebedee’s wife’s intersection to clarify the limit of his powers, you may also use this visit to clarify your concerns about the plight of Cameroonians, to which France has contributed directly or indirectly.
You are visiting Cameroon, when citizens of native West Cameroon are yearning for greater autonomy or outright autonomy from mainland francophone Cameroon because of the French colonial legacy of assimilation. President Biya himself confessed to have found difficulty absorbing the Anglophone minority when he last visited France, but for their tenacity. Today, Anglophones and those who have opted to call themselves ‘Ambazonians’, are monitoring every move of yours in Cameroon today and looking up to knowing whether you have understood anything about their language since 2016.
Like James, the first apostle to be martyred, thousands of native West Cameroonians have been martyred for their fate in the former British colonial heritage for their English language and common law system. You are visiting when the remaining few surviving English-speaking Cameroonians are ‘afflicted in everyway, but not perplexed; persecuted but not forsaken; struck down but not destroyed’, (confer 2 Corinthians 4:7-15). And still hoping you may do something (even though a majority do not believe in your sincerity).
Like Jesus, you may be telling them you don’t have the powers to divide Cameroon into two (that is, grant the wish of Ambazonians), but you can bring pressure to bare on our leadership to grant native West Cameroonians (living in the North West and South West Regions), greater autonomy. France’s concern about the welfare of minorities pushed them to fight for greater autonomy for Quebec in Canada.
Today those living in the French speaking region of Canada proudly refer to themselves as nationals of Quebec in a united Canada. That is why Canadian Prime Minister could easily declare that Quebecois are Quebec nationals in a united Canada. That is why they enjoy greater advantages than ordinary Canadians. That is why they attend schools in France on home tuition. That is why they go to ‘Le Jeux de la franchophonie’ with a Quebecois-only football team, not Canadian national team as Cameroon does for Commonwealth games, year-in, year-out. That is why it suffices for any Canadian to declare that he/she is Quebecois and becomes one, just as Cameroon nationality code indicates who can become a native West Cameroonian.
His Excellency, can you impress it on Cameroon leadership that a better way of ensuring Cameroon remains one and indivisible would be to replicate the Canadian example of special status to the Cameroon situation?
Would you be kind enough to reason President Paul Biya to the effect that if he continues delaying on granting greater autonomy, many an English-speaking Cameroonian could change their minds, given that the Universal Declaration of human rights is categorical on the fact that no one be forced to belong to a country s/he no longer shares its modus operandis and modus vivandis?
Given that with technological advancement and free movement today, nationality has been reduced to one’s ability to contribute to the social, cultural, political and economic growth a country, not just the fact that one is born there and that the constitution states so (and many a native West Cameroonian are not fulfilling such criteria toward Yaounde today), can His Excellency from France agree with His Excellency at Etoudi, that henceforth, native West Cameroonians should proudly refer to themselves as Ambazonian nationals living in a united Cameroon?
Even if the point were not to go back to 1961, can English-speaking Cameroonians be offered the same privileges Quebecois have in Canada today? Can they be allowed to organize their Anglo-Saxon school and common law systems their own way? Could they be allowed to take part in Commonwealth games with the Ambaxonian-only team as Québec does for la francophonie games? Affaire a suivre…
In the meantime, welcome Mr.Emmanuel Macron, French Président. Kindly make hey while the sun shines.

According to Cameroon News Agency, the incident took place on July 22, 2022, when a suspected member of “Bafut 7 Katar” fighters group, stopped a bike rider at a checkpoint, demanding the sum of 2000 CFA.


Unable to comply with the suspected fighter’s request, the latter resorted to impounding the bike, which resulted in a fierce fight between both parties.

Attracted by the fight, passersby rushed to the scene and decided to take sides with the biker. They poured their wrath on the suspected Amba fighter, leaving him in a helpless state.


According to these residents, they have had enough of the constant extortion from both the fighters and the armed forces.

On July 12, 2022, news emerged that Ambazonia commander, Lekeaka Olivier Fongunueh, better known as Field Marshall, had been killed by Cameroonian soldiers. The news was confirmed when videos showed the Cameroonian army gloating over Field Marshall’s death by displaying his body in a public square in the Southwestern city of Kumba – a clear indication of “victory” and a move meant to instill fear in other separatist leaders across the region.

The move by Cameroon’s military brings to mind the prophetic words of the Hon. Joseph Wirba in 2016. This was just a few months into the current phase of the Anglophone Crisis. Wirba said then that:



“…The people of West Cameroon cannot be your slaves. The people of West Cameroon are not, you did not conquer them in war…



…Ten years ago, and I took my time drove from Kumbo to Yaounde to tell him ‘Something is brewing out there. This thing that you people are sending gendarmes to beat people up and say all of these things, there is pain in West Cameroon and as Minister of Justice, be very careful and he turned around, looked at me and told me ‘Mr. Wirba , it your people who chose to come here. He is alive, he told me.

Last week I went to see the Minister of Higher Education, Prof. Fame Ndongo and I told him ‘The problems we have in West Cameroon is the problem that will bring down Cameroon. If you do not handle it well you will not know Cameroon as it is in a few months or in a few years…”.



In December 2017, Crisis Group International warned then that the preceding events of December 2016 in which hundreds were killed in Bamenda and several others arrested, were symptomatic of an armed conflict that could escalate:

“This sharp deterioration in the situation requires an urgent response from Cameroonian President Paul Biya…

Due to such murderous repression, secessionist ranks are growing by the day, and some are more firmly evoking the idea of an armed struggle or “self-defense”. If he hopes to avoid an armed uprising in Anglophone regions, which would, without doubt, have an impact in the Francophone zone, the Cameroonian president must go beyond superficial measures and take responsibility in order to find political solutions to the crisis…”.



It seems as though Cameroonian authorities have not realized that they are dealing with an ideological crisis and you do not silence an ideology by shooting people or arresting them. This would explain why the arrest of Nelson Mandela by the apartheid government in South Africa did not make opponents of the struggle waver. Mandela was just one facet of the many fighters who opposed racist apartheid laws that forbade blacks and whites from mingling in South Africa.

This would also explain why the United States has been unable to win the war against terror in the Middle East. Americans are increasingly atheists while Taliban supporters have strong religious convictions that spur them to keep fighting even when several Taliban leaders have been killed by American soldiers. It is a war of ideology and not necessarily one of arms. The US would need to have a better alternative to offer to Taliban supporters other than bombing them to smithereens.



Cameroonian authorities by now ought to have realized that they are not winning the war in Anglophone zones by killing a handful of separatist fighters. Yes, the fighters may be killed but the ideology that convinced them to pick up arms in the first place will still remain after they are gone. The frustrations that pushed them into the bushes will still be there after their deaths but that quest for justice will still be there. Cameroon needs to admit that there is a problem and learn from other African countries where civil wars did not end because of the killing of warlords.

Riek Machar, a former warlord in South Sudan redeemed himself and later became a leading politician in his country after fighting against the government of the day as had John Garang before him.

There is the glaring case of Charles Taylor in Liberia, probably one of Africa’s best-known warlords. Taylor would topple the government of Samuel Doe and later become president of the country in 1997.



The list is very long and an article like this cannot do it justice but the point is that Anglophones do not condone violence. It is easy for the powers that be to simply point at the current armed conflict (which they partly caused by not listening to organizations like the Crisis Group) on Anglophones. However, Anglophones started by complaining that they needed the judicial and educational systems to be reformed to give them more leverage to manage affairs in these domains. At the time, the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC) petitioned the government and said the best way for peace was for a return to (not something new) the two-state federation which existed from 1961 to 1971.

Field Marshal is not the totality of the Anglophone Crisis. In fact, Field Marshal only rose and became known as a result of the Anglophone Crisis. Six years down the line, one would expect that our leaders would have understood that a military offensive is not working. Countless warlords or militia fighters have been killed, but more and more keep cropping up.

This should be an indication to government that the military solution is NOT working and that dialogue is the way out. Boasting about killing one warlord is not going to end the Anglophone Crisis. It does not take a magician to understand that Field Marshal’s demise will likely not change the status quo.

Several generations of English-speaking Cameroonians have taken up this struggle at different times and in different ways. This may likely be the case unless the authorities take steps to hold an inclusive dialogue and take time to listen (not lecture) the people about what they want and feel is best to address the concerns they have raised for the past several years.


Failure to do so will only help the words of Pakistan’s Malala to ring true:


“They can only shoot a body. They cannot shoot my dreams, they cannot kill my beliefs”.

0,Mbanga DO blames population for Amba attack on gendarme in Matuke,"June 15, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The Divisional Officer of Mbanga, Tamboh Christian has blamed inhabitants over the killing of a gendarme officer in Matuke, Mbanga subdivision of the Moungo division, Littoral Region of Cameroon.

This was during a field visit to the locality where he decried the fact that the inhabitants have refused to denounce security threats in their area.


On June 10, a gendarme officer identified as Simbe Herman was reportedly ambushed by Ambazonian fighters while on his way to Pendamboko, a locality bordering with the Crisis-hit South West region.

Adressing the population, he reiterated that only the residents could be held responsible for the such acts.


“We don’t need to blame the vigilante group, but all of you here. It is a very serious case. Those guys couldn’t have come in this village without the bike riders noticing them, since they must have surely carried them” said Temboh Christian.

He continued that “they slept in the bush throughout the night and none of you did notice, not even the farmers.”

As if not enough, the civil administrator went on to indict the chiefs, whom he said are more familiar with the people and ought to put in effort in avoiding such scenarios.


“I have told you that an officer doesn’t know who is a native and who is a stranger, so you the Chiefs are supposed to help,” the DO said.

It should be recalled that this is not the first time that administrative authorities have attributed blame to locals over attacks by separatists.


Recently, the population of Njipaton in the Noun Division of the West region, was attributed blame after Ambazonian fighters attack a gendarmerie post in the area killing five forces including the head of the post.

Government soldiers have killed three persons in Bamali Ndop, Ngoketunja division of the North West region.
Among those killed are two civilians and one suspected separatist fighter, a villager has told MMI.
They were shot death in a drinking spot  Sunday June 12, 2022 .
Their bodies were later  displayed “as trophy” by state security forces on the street of Ndop.
Another source says the suspects were ambushed while drinking in a popular joint in Bamali.
“……….the military came in civilian attires on a motorcycle and opened fire into the bar after getting a tipoff that separatists were there drinking,” a villager told MMI on phone.
According to reports, a separatist commander was killed including a commercial motor bike rider, who is a alleged to be a former fighter.
The third victim is a young man who had just taken part in a community water project same day.
“He was at the scene when soldiers arrived, having a chat with his friends when he was shot… Soldiers say he is Amba, but he is now,” said our source.
“The person in black pant on display was not an Amba fighter”, the source said insisted, adding that ,”we had just finished working on a water project and he went to that bar where the Amba Boys were drinking.”
The young man according to reports sustained gunshots wounds and was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment when he was siezed by the military and executed publicly.
“The guy was shot but, he did not die immediately. His family  took him to the hospital for treatment,” said the source.
“The military followed  and took him out of the hospital to the main junction and shot him dead in the presence of the population.”
“He was a motorcycle repairer and had no business with Amba,” the source revealed regretting that: “he was the one keeping the key of that community water. What are we going to do now?”
Only one of them is said to be a Separatist fighter, according information gathered by MMI.
“The fat man is a well known Ambazonia fighter. He is Amba commander for Bamali, the small one in the middle was a bike rider here,” our source said.
The killings come few days after Separatists killed a soldier at a check point in Bamenda and a civilian motorcycle rider as well.

0,Some Wututu locals protest against military departure in their locality,"June 13, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Some Wututu locals stage protests against military departure from their locality
A number of persons today Sunday, June 12, 2022, thronged the streets of Wututu, Limbe in the South West Region to prevent the departure of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) from their locality.
According to reports, the military had terminated their mission in the area and were set to leave for “Man O War Bay”.
In a video, the locals were spotted lying in front of military vehicles, some hanging on the tires, while others could be spotted mounting blocks by the roadside.
According to these locals, the departure of the military will likely increase their vulnerability to Ambazonian attacks. This is, according to them because there has been some degree of calmness since the arrival of the military in the locality.
The situation, however, remains ironic considering the fact that MMI, has on several occasions covered incidents where the military has ill-treated residents of the same locality.
Meanwhile, many have perceived the protest as a staged act by the government and its supporters.
It should be noted that the opinion of these locals does not in any way represent the general opinion of those in the Division as a whole.
Many locals who spoke to MMI indicated that the military and Ambazonian fighters were just two-sides of the same coin and that they will prefer peace to the presence of any armed group.
It should be recalled that in many instances, the forces of law and order have been implicated in acts of violence against residents of the Anglophone regions. They account for multiple rights violations including the notorious Ngarbuh massacre and the torture of a young man in Ndu just before last year’s May 20 national day celebration.
To date, none of them has been brought to justice for the said acts.

0,Mamfe residents take to streets to protest burning of General Hospital,"June 12, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Inhabitants of Mamfe have taken to the streets massively, to protest the burning of the Mamfe General Hospital in the Manyu division, South West Region, by Ambazonian fighters.


The population reportedly came out in their numbers to condemn the burning down of the hospital building.


They carried with them placards with messages such as “Let love lead” “We need peace”, “Life is sacred” to mention a few.


The Senior Divisional Officer for the Manyu Division, Oum II Joseph was at the head of the peace protest. Oum Joseph used the opportunity, to urge the population to collaborate with the administrative authorities and ensure they get rid of fear.

“We Cannot settle this situation without your collaboration. The collaboration of our people, the collaboration of the whole population of Manyu.”


Tabechong Robertson, Mayor of Mamfe, pointing fingers at the Ambazonian forces, strongly condemned the burning down of infrastructures and urged them to drop their arms.


He noted “We are sick and tired of burning. We are begging them let them stop burning our properties. It’s not by burning our properties that they will separate the fight.”


Many Ambazonian leaders, Activists and sympathisers have long since condemned the burning of the hospital, denying responsibility and pointing accusing fingers at government forces.


The main cry of the inhabitants, however, remain the need for peace to reign in Manyu.

0,Separatists burn down Mamfe District hospital,"June 9, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By David Atangana
The Mamfe District hospital, in Manyu Division, South West Region of Cameroon has been burned to ashes.
The health facility came under attack at about 10:00PM, Wednesday June 8, 2022.
Eyewitness accounts say Separatists, who have been fighting for an independent state called Ambazonia set the hospital on fire after overpowering security guards in a fierce gunfire exchange.

Patients recieving treatment are reported to have “snailingly struggled to move out of the building on fire.”
It is not known wether human was life lost — as hospital officials are still evaluating loss incurred.
According to an amateur viral video making rounds on social media, it appears nothing was taken out of the structure.
“This is Mamfe hospital completely burnt down. It was burnt down yesterday by Ambazonians,” explains an eye witness who can be heard recording the ruined hospital structure.
Dazed and confused, few patients who managed to escape are seen wailing in disbelief.
At dawn, the entire health facility was down in ruins.
Though, fingers are pointing at armed separatists, no group has claimed responsibility.
The government is yet to react.

Fresh violence in the ongoing secessionist conflict in the Cameroons English-speaking regions has claimed the lives of at least 18 — including soldiers and civilians recently.
According to reports, 9 armless civilians were killed in Missong Fungom subdivision, Menchum division of the North West region.
Government soldiers opened fire in an indiscriminate shooting leading to the macabre act incident on June 1st, 2022, admitted the Yaounde regime on Tuesday.

Cyrille Atonfack, Spokesman for the Ministry of Defense in a statement June 7th, 2022, admitted that Cameroonian soldiers committed the atrocity — but said “it was unfortunate.”
“Retaliation”
On June 8, a contingent of Separatist Ambazonia fighters under the Command of ‘Field Marshal’ No Pity stormed a gendarmerie control post in Njitapon, Noun division of the French speaking West region killing at least 9 elements of state security forces.
The commander of the Gendarmerie Post was amongst soldiers killed –others reportedly flee.
According to reports security forces were overpowered by the invading separatists.
The fighters set the control post and a pick up security vehicle ablaze.
Bodies of dead soldiers were equally set ablaze, according to a footage of the attack obtained by MMI.
The fighters were also seen jubilating at the scene of the attack making derogatory remarks at Cameroon’s security forces, as the control Post is consumed with fire.
‘Field Marshal’ No Pity later appeared in another video ‘thanking’ God for guiding him.
“I No Pity, thank the almighty God, I fear no man, except God. No man can destroy me, but God alone and you all know that,” said No Pity.

Separatists wage war against commercial bikers for snubbing 20th May boycott","June 4, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Amba fighters have declared war on commercial motorbike riders in Funding, chief town of Boyo division of the North West Region.

The decision was taken after the said riders ignored calls for the boycott of the 20th May celebration.


On Wednesday June 1,nine bikers were reportedly caught and had their bikes set ablaze by suspected Ambazonia fighters.

This however came more than a week after inhabitants were banned from using the roads linking Fundong to Bamenda, passing through Njinikom.


According to reports, vehicles had been banned in Fundong, leaving inhabitants with bike riding as the only means of transportation.

Amba fighters according to sources, blocked the highway leading to Njinikom, which was later re-opened following an operation staged by the forces of defense and security.


The fighters have repeatedly blocked the Fundong-Bamenda road, which according to them is a way of punishing the Fundong people for going against their rules.

0,Crise anglophone : Flou autour de la libération de la sénatrice Regina MUNDI,"June 1, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Les contours de la mise en liberté de l’élue sont incertains.
Depuis hier, la sénatrice Elisabeth Regina MUNDI est libre. La nouvelle de sa relaxe a été rapidement reprise sur les réseaux sociaux et les plateformes numériques. Un peu comme le 29 avril dernier lorsque que l’élue du Nord-Ouest est arrêtée en pleine ville de Bamenda en compagnie de son chauffeur.
Prenant la parole devant les médias à l’aéroport de Bafut où a atterri le Gouverneur Adolphe Lele l’Afrique venu spécialement accueillir l’ex-captive, le membre du bureau politique du RDPC a remercié en priorité le Chef de l’État pour sa libération.
Plus loin, elle admet, après avoir écrasé des larmes, ” ce pays est en guerre, une vraie guerre”.
Mais la liberté retrouvée de la femme de 79 ans laisse des zones d’ombres et nourrit la controverse.
Bilan polémique
Selon l’armée, la sénatrice Elisabeth Regina MUNDI a été libérée après deux jours de combats avec les groupes armés. Des affrontements qui se seraient déroulés du dimanche 29 au lundi 30 mai 2022 dans la petite localité de Oschong dans l’arrondissement de Batibo département de la Momo au nord ouest. Le porte-parole du ministère de la Défense, le capitaine de vaisseau, Cyrille Serge ATONFACK NGUEMO a indiqué que ces combats auraient abouti à la libération de ” plusieurs otages” y compris la sénatrice, mais également à la neutralisation (tuerie dans le langage militaire) d’une “dizaine de terroristes” et trois autres “capturés”.
En dehors de ce bilan humain, des “fusils d’assaut et des munitions de divers calibres”, ” quatorze Engins explosifs improvisés” auraient été saisis ; ceci ajouté au véhicule de la sénatrice.
Mais tout cet arsenal n’a pas été aperçu, ni à l’aéroport, ni plus tard. Encore moins les otages supposés libérés avec la parlementaire, ni les 3 séparatistes que l’armée dit avoir arrêté. La non-présentation de ces équipements et des personnes censées avoir été libérées tranche étrangement avec les pratiques communicationnelles de l’armée Camerounaise.
Habituellement, elle filme ces butins et en fait une large publicité sur les réseaux sociaux et dans les médias.
Autre élément interrogateur, l’état des militaires ayant ramené la sénatrice Elisabeth Regina MUNDI. Il s’agit d’un groupe d’une dizaine de soldats du Bataillon d’intervention rapide, le BIR. On les voit tous propres, notamment à travers leurs rangers que certains internautes ont vite fait de mettre en exergue, dénonçant une supercherie.
La question qu’on pourrait se poser est celle de savoir comment le Gouvernement a obtenu la libération de la parlementaire. D’autant que lorsqu’elle est enlevée en fin avril, les auteurs de l’enlèvement, particulièrement les ADF, Ambazonian Defense Forces, branche armée de Ambazonia Gouvernment Council, l’un des organes exécutifs réclamant la sécession des régions Anglophones (groupe dirigé par LUCAS AYABA CHO établi en Norvège et que certaines sources soupçonnent être de mèche avec certains membres du Gouvernement Camerounais) exigent l’échange de 75 prisonniers anglophones. On sait au moins que cette transaction n’a pas eu lieu.
La piste du paiement d’une rançon est désormais peut-être la plus plausible. Elle est fortement évoquée en tout cas par plusieurs sources dignes de foi. Le montant de 45 millions est évoqué.
Autre élément, le “commandant stratégique” des ADF (Daniel Capo de son vrai nom Emmanuel NDONG qui vit en Chine) a annoncé hier que la sénatrice avait été touchée lors des combats avec l’armée et que sa survie était incertaine. Une vidéo postée sur YouTube alors que l’ex-otage avait déjà été libérée et même rapidement présentée à la presse.
En tout cas, on n’est pas sorti de l’auberge dans une crise que le conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés vient de classer comme la troisième crise la plus négligée au monde, après la crise à l’Est de la RDC et au Burkina Faso.

“Our forces acted bravely. Three of our soldiers were wounded with one in a critical state but will survive. Non of our forces were captured.

0,Freed Senator Regina Mundi recounts ordeal in Amba captivity,"May 31, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"CPDM member of parliament, Senator Regina Mundi has been recounting her ordeal while in Amba captivity.
In an interview with newsmen in Bamenda shortly after her release, Senator Regina Mundi described how her kidnapping and eventual release from captivity has left her speechless.
“As a teacher politicians, I should not lack words, but there are times when the emotions are too heavy,” said Senator Mundi in tears.
The lawmaker of the ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement Party, CPDM went on to thank the government, security officials – particularly the head of state who secured her release.
Mundi was kidnapped on April 30th 2022 in Bamenda, by separatists fighting for a break-away state called Ambazonia.
Without any precision, the Senator said she has seen enough to be told in just a day.
“This country, this region is at war, real war,” she maintained.
“It is not easy, it is really difficult for the military,” said Senator Mundi.
She continued that:
“In our country, everyone is treated fairly and equally.”
Other captives were released alongside Senator Mundi.
Separatists described her as one of those “enabling the Yaounde regime to marginalise and oppress the Anglophone population.
Earlier today, the communication head of the defence ministry in Cameroon said the Senator was released during a special operation between May 29 and 30th 2022.
Her abduction further sheds light on the deteriorating human rights situation in the Anglophone Regions.
She summarised her experienced in one word: loosely translated as So much to say, constrained by time.
