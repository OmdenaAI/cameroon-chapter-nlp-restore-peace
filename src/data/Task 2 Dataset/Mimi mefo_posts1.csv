Anger has filled the hearts of the people of Guzang, a village in Batibo Sub Division, North West Region of Cameroon, after one of theirs, a lady in her 70s was allegedly raped and shot to death (execution style) by members of Cameroon’s defense forces.
The incident occurred on Wednesday, October 19.
Our findings revealed that the incident happened when the victim returned from having a bath and just when she was about applying lotion on the body, soldiers forced their way in and met her naked.
“The woman had just taken her bath and was in her room when the soldiers entered. many who saw them took cover and after sometime in her room, we heard gun shots. When they left, we rushed there only to see her naked body in the pool of her own blood. We are saddened and I feel like fighting back, enough is enough,” Acha, a native of Guzang said.
There has been no word from the authorites of the region including the Fon of Guzang, Mbahyamsig III on the incident.
This is coming weeks after a grand mother and a nursing mother were executed in Bali Nyonga and two others in Andek by government forces.
There are fears that these killings of unarmed civililians is rather escalating the consternation among the population of the embattled regions where a Separatist war is still ongoing.

“The military has been causing havoc in Mbessa Fondom, Belo sub division in Boyo division since morning,” a local who opted not to be named told MMI.
While watching from hilltops, the source said, they saw thick smoke emanating from houses.
“As of now a total of 12 houses has been razed to ashes, five bikes have been burned too,” the source added.
According to report, a man in an attempt to run for his life was killed and his child missing.
“One civilian by name Helbert Nshom was killed in an attempt to escape. The man was fleeing with his child before he was killed and since then the child has not been found,” the source went on adding that: “Only the father’s deceased body was discovered.”
“The military has also broken in to many shops and killed many goats, carting away what they met,” lamented our source.
The day seems to be long as villagers remain hiding in bushes inside the rains.
“Villagers are in the forest and it has been raining heavily in the village for hours now.”

0,Pinyin: Two brothers killed in military raid,"September 30, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Two young men whose names MMI got as Ticha and Chi were killed in a military raid in Pinyin, Santa Subdivision of the North West Region.

The raid took place on the morning of September 28 at about 4 a.m. precisely in the Kongfun neighborhood.

According to a source, one of the brothers happened to be an ex-amba fighter, who had settled in the Far North but had recently decided to visit his family in the village.

“He had long left the separatist group and went to the Far North, where he became a taxi driver. A week ago, he decided to visit the village to check on his mother with his younger brother who came along from Yaoundé,” a resident of the neighborhood told MMI.

The two young men were captured and killed “right in their mother’s house” our source added.

The mother of the two young men has remained inconsolable following the tragic demise of her two sons.

A private car has been shattered around Mile 14, Buea, South West Region of Cameroon.
MMI gathered that the owner of the car is reportedly in a critical state in the hospital, after being shot at.
Rare footages obtained by MMI show bloodstains in the car, stationed on the highway.
This follows an early morning shooting Wednesday September 7, 2022.
“This is the car that a guy was shot inside” a voice is overheard in the amateur video shot at the scene.
“It is by God’s grace that he is still alive” the person added zooming the bloodstains and shattered screens of the vehicle.
Armed Separatists reportedly opened fire on the vehicle in a bid to enforce a two weeks ghost town defied by the local population in some parts of the English-speaking regions.
The shooting allegedly led to a break down of circulation and economic activities in the South West Regional capital.
Fresh violence have been reported in most parts of the North West and South West regions since Tuesday leading to loss of lives, with some injured.
Uncertainty looms as threats Keep coming from armed separatists asking people to stay indoors till September 16, 2022.

0,Abdul Karim’s health failing due to precarious detention conditions – Lawyer,"August 20, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Lawyers defending Islamic scholar, Abdul Karim, arrested a week ago in Bamenda, North West Region, Cameroon, have told MMI in an exclusive interview, that the conditions under which he is being held are taking a huge toll on his health and wellbeing.
Abdul Karim is currently being shuffled between the Unit known as “Groupement” and the Gendarmerie brigade, as they take turns to interrogate him.
His lawyers have since pressed for better conditions for his detention, to no avail.
Talking to MMI, one of the lawyers on his case, Barrister Tifuh Ochard Nkeng of Andang and Associates Law office, Bamenda revealed that he was interrogated in their absence — which to him “is incorrect.”

“He was feeling much pain. He had nerve pains because the detention conditions are precarious. He was talking about bites which he suspects are bed bugs,” his defence lawyer told MMI.
To him, “the detention conditions are precarious. They are not doing anything about it… In the room where he is found, about 15 of them are in a 3-meter square area. They are there without a toilet so everybody will defecate in a bucket and they take it out.”

During his first four days behind bars, Abdul Karim had little to eat and did not take his bath. “Within this time, the wife and family were denied access to him,” said Barrister Tifuh.
How he was arrested
Abdul karim was arrested last weekend.
This was after he intervened to get an impounded car released from a security checkpoint.
After getting to the security post for the second time in the day, he was held back and a commander called to the scene.

“Prior to that action they had been looking for him but did not know who he is actually,” said his lawyer, adding that he was whisked off by a commander who pulled up in an armoured car.
His lawyers report that getting access to him was hard, as security officials where he is being held tried restricting access to keep him cut off from family and lawyers.
Charges against Abdul Karim
Accused of promoting acts of terrorism, Abdul Karim is being held in relation with the war in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
To his lawyer, the accusations “are trumped up charges they bring up once and again. He does not do anything in hiding and his work has nothing to do with the armed struggle.”
The scholar, he noted, has like any other dutiful citizen been trying to do what he can at his own level to bring peace.
The charges, Barrister Tifuh believes, are similar to other government actions regarding the armed conflict: “they are systematic so that they can pounce on the people …”
This is not the first time Abdul Karim is being detained.
His latest arrest strangely however, comes shortly after a video he made denouncing xenophobic acts by the soldier, who is also the chief of Bwassa village, Moja Moja.
Many see Abdul Karim’s arrest as part of the victimisation tactics the government has been using against English-speaking Cameroonian activists which has led to hundreds of languishing in jail, some without trial.

0,"Poet, Meh Buh Cyril remembers assassinated Fon of Esu","August 11, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"In a soul touching poem, the poet has paid glowing tributes to the Fon of Esu who was assassinated some months ago.
It is a compiling read.
A POEM: THE THROBBING BANG
The place is called Esu
And it is for Usu.
A land founded with a spear,
Now bounded by tears.
One that is cosmopolitan,
Hoping to be megalopolitan.
A land believed to be a fountain of peace,
But now a mountain apiece.
A people ever united,
Now so far divided.
A town always admired,
Today in a quagmire.
One that is supposed to be a spring of hope,
But now a spray of despair.
A Town known to have produced great Sages,
Today, seemingly an adage.
A people believed to be pacesetters,
But now seen scattered.
A community known to be victors,
Today seen victims.
One formerly dreadful to her adversaries,
But will be a mockery to her every mensiversary
Peace running away
And panic, the lone option
All these because of a rumour,
One we find it is not for humour.
Then confusion sets in,
What do we do then?
Blue blood has truly been spilled
And the ears of every Esu man are shrilled.
This makes my heart bleed,
But I cannot make their hearts beat.
This reduces the meaning of life
As no one seems safe.
The tap root is truly damaged
So the leaves and branches have no chlorophyll
Enormous questions are echoed;
Who has done this?
What are the person’s reasons?
What does the killer stand to gain?
Is there any reason enough to take away human life?
Does it have to be that barbaric and tragic?
What happens to the conscience?
Did Usu offend anyone?
Is death the solution to such squabbles?
Did peaceful negotiations fail?
What was the Queen’s own crime?
Could she not be spared?
Who is next?
I have continued to wonder
But the more I do,
The more I marvel.
And even in my desperation,
I can make no decision.
Esu is in complete devastation
And some are for black magic,
Saying the deaths are too tragic.
A majority pray to God the Father
As the pain extends further.
Most believe in Divine vengeance
But others instill deterrence.
People are questioned
But answers bring more questions.
Days and months pass,
But nothing seems to be done fast.
Accusations and counter accusations dominate our days
Yet, no facts advanced till this day.
Almost half a year gone already
And we keep asking the day the truth will be ready.
Most fingers point at the Meh Buhs,
Saying they caused this taboo.
This sounds ridiculous!!!
But this can never remain bayous
Booms of another set of questions emerge;
Who drove the Great Iroko home after the horror?
One of the Meh Buhs
Who “fixed” the lion there after?
One of the Meh Buhs
Who performed the greatest royal ritual that is usually done when an Iroko tree falls?
Still one of the Meh Buhs.
We know touching human blood is deadly
But touching blue blood is even more deadly.
Yet the ancestors remain indolent
While our Supreme God Almighty is still silent
Let the Heavens speak against the concerned
As our belts remain fastened
His ways are not our ways
Therefore we know His weapons sway
Yet tears fill our land
With fears we can’t understand.
The course of our development has been thwarted
But we remain strong hearted.
Usu as a people want justice
Because for now we are still in a hospice.
Lord come to our rescue
Since we don’t know if we’re on the right queue
Love and sincerity could be our catalysts
But who are going to be our stylists?
Justice remains our destination
But if we fail, it remains an abomination.
I ask myself,
Can we do anything on our own?
The answer is;
Usu, the Lord is your strength!!!

One of the Honorable members of Parliament from Ngoketunjia Divison of the war-ravaged North West Region says armed robbers are responsible for the killings and kidnapping of civilians in the two Anglophone regions.
The Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement, CPDM party MP made the revelation last Thursday, July 28, 2022, during the seventh session of the North West Regional Assembly.
“Let me tell you, they killed senators, these are not Ambas, these are armed robbers who are pretending to be Amba fighters. There are no armed robbers in Yaounde, Douala, and the other big cities of Cameroon. They have all moved to the North West and South West regions. We must do everything to eliminate these dangerous elements so that we can develop our communities,” Njingum Musa told the North West Regional Assembly.
The Parliamentarian’s outing came at a time when Separatists who are fighting to restore an independent state called “Ambazonia” have come under increasing fire for the massive killing of civilians.
Njingum Musa’s declarations, however, contradicts some credible human rights organisations that have also documented civilian killings carried out by separatist fighters as well as government forces.
They say many more unarmed civilians will continue to die needlessly as the violence continues unchecked.

The Member of Parliament for Ndop-Babessi, Ngoketunja Division of the North West Region, Hon Njigum Musa has revealed that armed separatists fighters operating in Ngohketunjia Division are strangers brought in from elsewhere.
Hon Njingum Musa told reporters in Bamenda July 27th, 2022, on the sidelines of the 7th session of the North West Regional Assembly.
To the lawmaker who is Questor at the National Assembly, those he considered ‘dangerous elements’ in his division of origin are not children of the area.
“I have made census of all those who are carrying out this act of terrorism in Ngohketunjia and very few Ngohketunjia children are inside,” Hon Njingum said.
“They import them from neighbouring localities to come and cause havoc” he added, emphasizing that ‘……..that is why we need a military base. It is a necessity not a luxury.”
It should however be recalled, that Ngohketunjia division remains one of the major strongholds of armed separatists in the restive North West region.
It harbours the base of ‘General’ No Pity, a dreaded separatist commander who has severally dealt huge blows on the defense and security forces in separate attacks.
Earlier on, the MP mounted the rostrum of the Regional Assembly calling on elite of the region to join hands and eliminate persons whom he referred to as ‘dangerous elements’.
“Let’s each and everyone of us start thinking of how we can eradicate these dangerous elements,” he told regional representatives adding that: “there are no armed robbers in Douala and Yaounde.All the armed robbers have come to the North West and South West killing under the guise of Amba.”
“If We don’t eradicate them, I bet you, move carelessly even here in up-station, you will go,” he intimated.

0,Chris Anu confirms bloody military invasion of ‘Field Marshal’s camp: casts more doubts on outcome,"July 14, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Diaspora-based separatist leader, Chris Anu has confirmed a military attack on the camp of his brother and Ambazonian self-styled ‘Field Marshal.’
The attack took place in Lebialem in the restive South West Region.
Chris Anu in a statement broke the silence over a bloody military attack carried out in the hideout of Oliver Lekeaka aka Field Marshal in Menji.
“My fingers are still crossed as yours. Right now I cannot say with certainty that FMA is killed or alive. I have, however, confirmed that there was a severe LRC invasion of his camp,” he stated.
Following the said attack, not a single fighter in Mr. Lekeaka’s camp is yet to be accounted for, he revealed.
Unlike when other separatist ‘generals’ were killed by the Cameroon military, no official government outlet has mentioned the death or circumstances of the incident.
The only confirmation of the death of Oliver Lekeaka was posted on the Facebook page run by the military, with a large following but it is not Facebook verified page.
The army spokesperson has, however, been conspicuously silent.
In addition to the posting on the military Facebook page, images said to be of Mr. Lekeaka’s corpse keep making rounds on pro-government social media platforms. In the images, can be seen members of the dreaded Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) posing next to a maimed corpse.
Field Marshal’s nine lives
For years now, many reports have claimed ‘Field Marshal’ was killed by government forces. Yet, after everyone one of these claims, he continued wreaking havoc, laying waste to their declarations.
This made many refer to him as a proverbial cat said to have nine lives and can survive almost any difficulty.
However, since news of him being killed most recently went out on Tuesday 12th July 2022, neither he nor anyone close to him has refuted the allegation.
His brother, Chris Anu however remains hopeful, noting that the only proof of death will be the presentation of the corpse: “Only until then would I confirm that FMA has indeed fallen. The photos on social media just do not look like him.”
“… What we see in social media just doesn’t look like him. Whatever the case, we will know with certainty in a matter of hours,” he added.
What next?
For a long time, ‘Field Marshal’ was the most dreaded separatist fighter clamouring for the breakaway of Cameroon’s English-speaking regions.
Multiple attempts by the army to bring him down failed.
While his influence appears to have dwindled over time, the soldiers’ fear is not over.
Another separatist self-styled ‘General’ known as ‘Field Marshall No Pity’ is wreaking similar havoc in the North West Region.
He has even claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the French-speaking West region, including a recent one on a Gendarmerie post.
His rise continues to question the government’s modus operandi of using violence to address the Anglophone problem.
While multiple separatist ‘generals’ have already been killed by the Cameroon military and some by infighting among the different separatist camps, this has not reduced the intensity of the war.

0,Cameroon: Separatist Commander kills two civilians in Bamali.,"July 6, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By David Atangana
Two civilians are reported to have been killed in Bamali, Ndop of Ngoketunja Division of the North West Region of Cameroon.
The acts condemned by locals were carried out by self-proclaimed ‘General’ Leonard Tatoh, an armed separatist commander in the locality.
Sources say he executed a certain Sacho Mathias around one week ago.
Meanwhile, Lawrence Mango, a businessman, met the same fate on Tuesday, July 5, 2022.
He was reportedly shot dead at Three Corners Bamali, the most popular junction in the small village, neighbouring Bamessing and Bamunka.
Steeped in confusion as a result of the latest targeting of harmless civilians, villagers say the action of the separatists is likely a reprisal against the killing of Separatist ‘General Transporter’ a little over a week ago by government soldiers.
“Last week Amba General Transporter was killed and so-called General Leonard Tatoh is blaming the people of Bamali for collaborating with the military”, a local lamented.
Same source said, “………these two civilians killed had nobody working with the government not to talk of the military.”

“Mr. Lawrence was my uncle. He was a rice trader and had no business with Amba “, a family relative told MMI, adding, “He was picked by Separatists on his way to supply rice in Bamenda. All his goods plus money were seized before he was shot dead.”
A victim of separatist atrocities who opted not to be named also lamented that the fighters have found delight in killing, harassing, and kidnapping them for ransom.
“Last month my grandma was kidnapped and a ransom of 800,000FCFA was taken from me before her release, for no reason,” said the victim, adding that, “am not a civil servant, am just a businessman, and they told me I have not supported them in the war.”
The current conflict that started in 2016 with a demand by lawyers and teachers for reforms, which they hoped will mitigate the marginalisation of the English-speaking minority in Cameroon, has long metamorphosed into a bloody conflict where civilians are the most targeted for reasons far removed from the original objectives uprising.

At least 11 separatist fighters have been captured by members of the Cameroonian defense force in Babadjou, West Region of Cameroon.
This comes after the fighters attempted to launch an attack in the town, MMI has learned.
In the very early hours of Tuesday June 28, 2022, the group of Separatist Fighters is believed to have invaded the West Region.
“Frightened civilians were awoke by sounds of heavy gunshots as the Separatists allegedly made their way to the Babadjou Gendarmerie post,” narrated a source.
The fighters were met with stiff resistance from the Gendarmes, who were tipped off.
“The Separatists were quickly supressed by the forces, and 11 of them were captured alive in the process.”
Several weapons, including guns were seized from the fighters.
They are also being detained pending investigations.
This failed attempt by Separatists comes barely three weeks after dreaded Ambazonian self-styled General “No Pity” attacked a Gendarmerie post in the West and killed over half a dozen elements.

According to reliable information given to MMI from sources in Lewoh, the ex-fighter, whose only name we got as Sammy, escaped to Yaoundé after deciding to abandon the fight.
After leaving the fight, Sammy reportedly fled to Yaoundé where he spent over two years, away from the war in the Anglophone zones.
“Sammy returned with the hope that all had returned to normal in the village, where he was shot by fighters on ground,” explained a source.
After being spotted by active separatist fighters in Lewoh, he was shot on the spot and killed on Friday, June 24, 2022.
It is unclear why Sammy was summarily executed. While some hold the view that he was treated as a traitor and could not be trusted, others highlight that this is another sign of how things have degenerated into chaos in the conflict-hit regions.
Some shades of opinion highlight the fact that Ambazonian fighters have become judges, juries and executioners, mainly against their own.
Sammy’s body has been laid to rest.

0,Citizens Make Shocking Revelations As Bamenda Based DJ Accused For Detonating IED Is Freed,"May 7, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Soulemanu Buba
A young man by the name of Ambe Hubert arrested and tortured by government forces for allegedly detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED)at the Commercial Avenue neighborhood in Bamenda has been released.
Ambe was arrested on April 1, 2022, following the explosion. He was torturetld and molested, and his pictures circulated on social media by regime supporters who considered him and “Amba terrorist.”
Following his release from detention, many people have intensified calls for the government to pay for damages he suffered, especially with his public image.
According to a Human Rights Lawyer who voted for anonymity, all those behind his arrest should be tracked in court,
“This is how they arrest people and some go missing while others are forced to pay huge sums of money to regain their freedom. He should be compensated and all those who tortured him be arrested for justice to be served.” The lawyer insinuates.
What A Team Of MMI Reporters Discovered After Labor Day Arrests and Torture.
Investigations carried out by our team in Bamenda uncovered that many others were also arrested that same night at Savannah Street by soldiers, and brutally tortured.
Huge sums of money were also collected from the victims who were still recovering from the torture at the hands of the soldiers.
Unconfirmed reports alleged that one of the detainees who had challenged a soldier to drop his weapon and face him in a physical tussle has not been seen ever since.
We also gathered that a young girl was raped by two soldiers in a garage around that area for not being in possession of her National Identity Card.
“She was dragged and raped behind an old vehicle, we heard how she was crying but since they had guns, there was nothing we could do to save her,” one of the tortured victims told MMI.
These are just some of the pain the population has been subjected to in the hands of government forces and there has been no condemnation coming from the Northwest administration.
Even when separatist fighters commit attrocities against the local population, it is always difficult for their leadership to condemn and bring them to order.
While all these happen, the masses continue to suffer in the hands of the same people who say they are out to protect them.

Two civilians have been killed following a gun battle between government forces and separatist fighters in Bamenda, North West region of Cameroon.
The gun battle unfolded at the Ntaturu neighborhood in Bamenda.
The incident took place on the night of Easter Sunday.
Reports say soldiers stormed a drinking spot at the Ntaturu neighborhood in search of Separatist fighters operating in that area.
The raid later turned into a gun battle, Tse, an eye witness told MMI. “They came at about 11:00PM in a snack called Billy juice. We only heard gun shots coming from the soldiers and members of the Non State Armed Groups that were around responded. We ran for safety only to hear later that two of our friends have been killed,” Tse said.
A provision store owner whose identify cannot be revealed for security reasons said: “The soldiers earlier came to the travelers neighborhood and asked us to close our shops and that no place should be opened. We did as we were told because we knew they could easily turn their guns on us if we wasted the least time.

He is reported to have been shot death this Friday April 8th, following an attack by a rival force called Bui Unity Warriors controlled by ‘General’ No Pity.
A moment of relief and celebration is expected in Kumbo following the assassination of the dreaded self styled General Insobu, said a source in the area.
Our source who opted for anonymity went on to say: “the former General amongst other issues caused general pain on the people of Bui for years. He was known for imposing countless luckdowns, locking of markets, mass kidnapping for ransom and above all barred circulation of traffic between Ndonga Mantung and Bui for fives years.”
The Role of “No Pity”
Considering the continues pain, General No Pity, another renown Ambazonian general is reported to have made countless missions to Bui that resulted in the unification of minor separatists Commanders under general Mad Dog.
“Since the creation of Bui Unity warriors under General Mad Dog, Genaral Insobu has seen several of his fighters slain on daily basis and today, he took the cue himself,” said another source.
Who is Insobu?
Paying allegiance to Mr Samuel Sako, Insobu took over from late ‘General’ Chacha who was killed in similar circumstances in January 2020.
He commanded a Separatist militia called Bui warriors with base in Kikaikom, a locality in Kumbo,Bui division of the North West region.
The militia witnessed cracks some months back after a group of fighters in the group broke away to form Bui Unity Warriors under the influence of a dreaded Ngoketunja based commander who goes by the name ‘General’No Pity in collaboration with another long time rival group, the ADF.

The lifeless body of the young man was dumped in the vicinity following heavy gunshots on Tuesday April 5.
Some individuals told our team that but for the fear of the unknown, they would have taken upon themselves to bury to the corpse. “Our culture is not the one that disrespects corpses. we respect persons even at death, burrying him is not a problem, the only problem is with those who killed the young man,” Dickson a Bamenda denizen stated.

Osih Joshua Nambangi,SDF national vice chairman and member of Parliament for Wouri,has called on the United States of America to arrest and extradite, to Cameroon , leaders of the separatist Ambazonia movement, whom most of them live in the U.S.


The opposition lawmaker made the call Sunday June 19, 2022 on Canal 2 International. He had been invited to talk on the armed separatist conflict in the English speaking Northwest and Southwest regions.

“The United States must implement the international arrest warrants issued by the State of Cameroon to put the financiers of “Ambazonian” Terrorism out of harm’s way, this is the role of the Parliament and the Parliamentarian who represents the Sovereignty of our Country “ Osih said.

According to the Wouri MP, leaders of these armed groups must be repatriated to Cameroon.

He said the situation is critical to the point that even the families and villages of the leaders are being attacked by the same men they are sending money to.

It should be recalled that in 2021, Osih Joshua joined 61 Members of parliament of the ruling CPDM in signing a letter to the US Congress demanding the repatriation of Ambazonia leaders sponsoring armed groups in the restive North West and South west regions of Cameroon.

He came under heavy backlash from party colleagues for taking such a move but said he “had no regrets” and was ready to sign a second letter if necessary.

It is reported that the bodies of the Ambazonian fighters were displayed at the BICEC junction by the military.

The Senior Divisional Officer of Meme Division, Chamberlain Ntou’ou Ndong used the opportunity to call on those still in the bushes, to drop their arms or they will be killed as well: “Let me seize this opportunity to advise the whole population of Meme Division to tell their children to join the DDR in Buea.” the administrator implored.

He further reiterated that joining the DDR is the only way out given to them by the Head of State.

“But for those who want to insist to fight the country, they can be reassured that at the end, they are going also to be neutralized,” Chamberlain emphasized

According to sources, the gang has been a great nuisance to the locality with constant attacks, kidnapping for ransoms, and seizure of farms amongst others.

It should be noted that the self-styled ‘General Deco’ is said to be amongst the inmates who joined the separatist fighters after being released from prison through a presidential pardon.

0,Ambazonia Defense Force threatens to execute Senator Regina Mundi if…,"May 11, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By David Atangana

The separatist armed group, Ambazonia Defense Forces ,ADF, has threatened to execute abducted Senator Regina Mundi. In a video making rounds on social media, self-styled deputy defense chief of the ADF, Capo Daniel claims the abducted Senator has been found guilty of what he said are several “crimes.”

Capo threatened that, Senator Mundi would be executed if the Government of President Paul Biya refuses to heed to earlier demands for the release of some key separatist figures in detention.
Senator Regina Mundi was abducted in Bamenda by ADF,a separatist militia ,on April 30,2022.

“It is more than a week since she was arrested and has been convicted by a military tribunal of the ADF on the ground. Our forces have since,for security reasons moved the location of Mrs Mundi twice”, the ADF official said, warning that,”there is a limit to how we can take risk for such a person who has enabled Cameroon to have a political cover to move around murdering our people”

Insisting that some separatist leaders held in government captivity must be released to safe the life of Mundi,Capo said the “conviction” of the Senator has been forwarded to the President of the ‘Ambazonia Governing Council’ for approval.

“Our defense forces have made preparations to carry out the execution of Mrs Regina Mundi if the government of Cameroon does not react by releasing at least members of the list we have provided to them starting with 75-year-old Nfor Ngala Nfor and his team kidnapped in Nigeria and sent to Cameroon by Biya and and Buhari regimes”,Capo Daniel declared, adding that other 37 members of his organization arrested in similar circumstances inTaraba Nigeria should also be released.

The ADF official also said, “failure of the Cameroon government to react,show value to the life of Mundi will result to her execution.We will not wait indefinitely”. This development comes barely a day after Andrew Nkea, Archbishop of Bamenda launched a plea for the release of the senator.

The population of Mbalangi, Mbonge subdivision of the South West region have reportedly killed three separatist fighters in the area.
The Amba boys are said to have been killed as they attempted disrupting a football match in the community.
According to inhabitants, the separatist fighters attempted to disrupt an ongoing football match claiming it was organised against a separatist-imposed ghost town.
Confusion is said to have swept across the community when the separatist fighters set a home ablaze.
In retaliation, scores of youths in the community descended on the armed men and manhandled them to death.
A local quoted one of those killed as having blamed the people for ” behaving as if the country is fine while the country is not. They tried to kidnap some players so they can go and kill them, but the crowd was alerted and few separatist fighters were apprehended and killed.”
The Senior Divisional Officer for Meme division, Ntou’oudong Chamberlin, later met the population.
He thanked the youths and assured them of the security put in place to ensure the smooth running of their daily activities in Mbalangi.
During his visit to Mbalangi, the administrator said, ” I came on behalf of the Head of State to appreciate the youths of Mbalangi who have finally decided to send away those criminals. We are going to do everything to ensure that the security is guaranteed in Mbalangi.”

0,"Burning of QRC Okoyong:
Ambazonia IG vows to disarm “rogue” armed groups, describes attack as shameful","February 12, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Tata Mbunwe

The ‘Interim Government of Ambazonia’ has issued a release condemning the recent attack on Queen of the Rosary College (QRC) Okoyong-Mamfe by alleged separatist fighters, stating that the targeting of schools is shameful and distasteful.


In a release published on Friday, Interim Government’s Vice President, Dabney Yerima, said they will disarm “rogue gangs operating with impunity in Ambazonia”.


“Any attack on a school in Southern Cameroons is shameful, distasteful, outrageous, and unacceptable and the perpetrators of these sorts of crimes do not represent our cause and people,” the release read.


Armed men, suspected to be separatist fighters, attacked the all-girls dormitory school on February 10, set fire on dormitories and administrative blocks.

Also condemning the attack, pro-separatist news website, Cameroon Concord, said the gang attacked the school to stop its plans of participating in the 11 February Youth Day celebrations.


“The Interim Government of Ambazonia condemns this cowardly act firmly and warns that it will take steps to disarm rogue gangs operating with impunity in Ambazonia. Our legitimate fight is against the invading army of La Republique du Cameroun, not against our student population,” the IG’s release reads.


“I take this opportunity to reiterate the position of your Interim Government that school campuses are no go areas for any Southern Cameroons group, be they Amba fighters.”


The Catholic-owned Queen of the Rosary College is the oldest gilrs secondary school in Cameroon created in 1956.


Often referred to as the cradle of girl child education in Cameroon, QRC Okoyong celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016.


The school has graduated some of Cameroon’s outstanding women among them Secondary Education Minister Nalova Lyinga; Prof Rose Gana Fomban Leke, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Medical Research Institute; Prof Theresa Tchombe Shalo, UNESCO Chair for Special Needs Education at the University of Buea; award-winning music star Daphne Njie, among others.


The attack in the school came just two days after armed men also burnt down a classroom at a Government Primary School in Buea.


Separatists in the Northwest and Southwest regions had in the past enforced school boycotts by killing, beating and kidnapping students and teachers.

Several schools have also been burnt and destroyed by separatist fighters who have enforced the boycott agenda.


Despite separatist leaders relaxing the anti-school stance in late 2020, schools remain closed in most surbubs of the two regions and those that go on even in towns like Buea and Bamenda still do so with caution.


The recent statement by the Ambazonia Interim Government is one of the boldest statements the separatists have made to condemn attacks on schools in the two regions.


The anti-school agenda alongside several atrocities committed by armed groups against civilians has placed separatist fighters at odds with the civilian population in most of the areas where they operate.


According to the Ambazonia IG, separatist fighters must pursue their goal “with unity and purpose” and with “wisdom and self-restraint”.

0,"We are not into any negotiations with the Cameroun government – Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, detained Ambazonia leader","February 5, 2022",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius, President of a faction of the Ambazonia Interim Government (I.G.) detained at the Yaounde Principal Prison in the Kondengui neighborhood says talks with the government have stalled. He outlines conditions for negotiations while stating their determination to commit to a ceasefire.

In a recent interview, Ayuk Tabe says their resolve is to make Cameroon’s North West and South West Regions an independent country called Ambazonia.

Arrested on January 5, 2018, in Abuja, Nigeria, and airlifted to Yaounde, Ayuk Tabe begins this interview by looking at his four years already spent in jail but says he has no regrets.
Read him below 👇🏾


Life in prison has never been reported by any inmate to be good or devoid of pain, neither is it fun. It is a life of pain especially as it concerns people who were hitherto very successful in life, than those who command the authority of injustices, who perpetrate injustice, and who unjustly sentence Ambazonians to jail time. The pain is much, especially considering the travesty of justice our people are experiencing from the system of la Republique du Cameroun (LRC). All Ambazonians whether in prisons or not are living in jail.
Those in LRC created jails are suffering so much pain and still being subjected to the agony of our land being desecrated. Many others are witnessing similar pain every day including those recruited to serve in the LRC system. The progressive land-of-my-birth blood flows strong in all our blood vessels. The LRC prison conditions are terrible and these are our everyday experiences.
How can anyone fathom the fact that detainees have to take care of their medical needs? However, the price of these sacrifices by Ambazonians is worth it because the freedom of a people is non-negotiable. Everyone is born free, why should we live in chains? We believe that a vast majority of our people want freedom and no such person will tell you a story of regrets embarking on this struggle. After all, no pain no gain.
We can only regret the fact that we did not undertake this restoration struggle earlier because 60 years of waiting is too long. Even you know, deep in your heart, that we have waited for too long, for acceptance which never came. If they hate you for who you are, nothing you do will change that, except you move away.


War has been raging in the North-West and South-West Regions for at least five years. What is your assessment of the current situation? What has changed?

To begin with, if the territory you are referring to is the Former UN British Trust Territory of the Southern Cameroons, I will appeal that you be schooled on the right vocabulary and the right nomenclature. This territory is the Southern Cameroons. How does it feel that a nation which accepted to join La République du Cameroun in 1961 is today being referred to by you as a region of La République du Cameroun? Which instrument of international law made La République du Cameroun grow and subsume another nation? Is this still part of the annexationist provocative appellation ‘North-West and South-West regions’ tendencies to reap our people off their history, identity, and prosperous future? We are Southern Cameroonians (Ambazonians). Get it right!

NB: When Mr. Paul Biya on the 30th of November 2017 declared war on the people of the Southern Cameroons, some boasted that in two weeks the LRC army will retain victory. The war of domination has been turned into a genocidal war, yet there is no victory in sight.
Five years and counting the victory that was envisaged is still a mirage. Our people acting in self-defense are becoming more understanding and committed, each passing day.
You would recall, they started with peace plants, and violence was blasted upon them. History teaches us that no external army has defeated a people in their land. Those who proclaimed and are executing this war should review the lessons of the wars in Vietnam, Eritrea, South Sudan, and recently in Afghanistan.
Short of off-rooting the indigenous people and planting yours, if you come and stay, eventually you will go back to yours and leave our land. The will of our people shall eventually prevail like it was with those nations cited. Note that the spirit of resistance is in the soul of humans and we are no less human than anyone on this planet.

So far, a genocide and Scotch-Earth policy is being perpetuated in our homeland with dire repercussions:- over 32,500 of our people have been died in targeted killings and massacres, over 550 villages razed down, over 1.5 million people have been displaced across the globe, as refugees and internally displaced persons, with Nigeria hosting over 120,000 of these refugees; thousands of our women, girls, and grand-children have been raped and abused; over 4,000 of our people have been incarcerated including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and babies; thousands have been maimed and tortured.
How devilish will one be, not to address such perpetrators? Despite the ongoing genocide and the egregious Human Rights abuses on our people, the international community has remained mute. Despite the high-sounding world proclamation of “Never Again”, genocide is happening again. Indeed, in the Southern Cameroons today, we are all witnesses to a replay of the Rwanda 1993/94 genocide, and the international community is watching silently. We call on everyone to press for the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to commission an International Fact-Finding Mission to the Southern Camerouns, to halt this genocide and gross human rights abuses; and bring the perpetrators to book. We call on Presidents Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, and other world leaders to call la Republique du Cameroun to end this bloodshed and address the root cause of this crisis.

What has changed is that more and more, our people are knowing where we come from; they understand why we are here and they visualize where we are heading to. If you understand the why, you can withstand anything to accomplish your objective.


How long do you think this war will last?

To call it a war, is to demonstrate ignorance of the reality on the ground. The right expression and to better rephrase your question is; For how long will this genocidal war on the People of Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia last?
People must understand that our people are acting in legitimate Self-Defense This genocidal war would stop if the one who declared it decides to call it off.

Our people are very conscious of what they want and are determined to get it, irrespective of the pain, sweat, or blood we shed.

Whether this genocide lasts for a short time or a long time, it will ultimately end with the Will of the people prevailing over any military might, assumed or real. It will end where it was supposed to begin … on the Negotiating Table.

On every occasion, we have tabled confidence-building measures that could bring this genocidal war to an end. They are:-
a) Mr. Biya should remove his military from our streets and villages;

b) Free all persons arrested and detained in connection with this crisis;

c) Grant free access to all our people in the Diaspora to be able to return without fear of being arrested, tortured, or detained;

d) The LRC government should commit to an internationally mediated settlement of the conflict, in a neutral venue mutually acceptable to both parties, with a mutually acceptable mediator.

These measures are modest and doable. The one who called the war should call it off, create an enabling environment to end it, and resolve this crisis from its roots. Otherwise, we see no other way out. We can do this today to save our people’s pain and death or they force us to wait for tomorrow, with the net effect being the hardening of positions on either side.



Do you support the implementation of the resolutions of the Major National Dialogue, including the attribution of a Special Status to the North-west and South-west regions?

To us, the Major National Dialogue was a non-event. Mr. Biya was talking to himself. On this issue, when Mr. Biya talks to Dr. Dion Ngute, he is talking to himself, the same as when he talks to Mr. Philemon Yang, Mr. Peter Mafany Musonge, Chief Tabetando, or Mr. Atanga Nji.

It is ridiculous to say that someone could grant what he/she doesn’t have. LRC lacks the legitimacy and moral standing to grant the Southern Cameroons any status. The future and destiny of any nation are in the hands of its people. Self-determination of a People is a fundamental right.
That is the path the people of the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia have opted to pursue. No status, whatsoever, can derail our people from this noble and costly goal.


Senator Henry Kemende was killed recently. The European Union maintains that it is the work of non-state actors. What do you think?

May the soul of Senator Barrister Henry Kemende rest in the peace of the Lord. May his family be consoled and remain firmly attached to God for strength. His assassination fits squarely in the ‘modus operandi’ of the forces of evil and their stock in trade:- of targeted elimination and massacres, in furtherance of their genocidal policy on Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia. Recall Baby Martha, Baby Carol, baby Tataw, journalist Wazizi, Ngarbuh, Pinyin, Kumba, Ekondo Titi, and Muyuka Massacres just to mention these few.

For a long, we have been calling on the International Community including the European Union and African Union to press for a UN Security Council-mandated Fact-Finding Mission to the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia to investigate these atrocities. This has not yet been done. The LRC government bars International Human Rights Organizations and Journalists from having access into the Southern Cameroons.
We are certain that the European Union relied on this one-sided story from reports of peripheral journalism to draw such a conclusion. We urge them to send a neutral international fact-finding mission to investigate the assassination of Barrister Henry Kemende and others.
The revelations of such a commission we believe will be very different from what is being propagated now. Let the LRC government open up to investigative journalists from CNN, Aljazeera, BBC, France 24, and others, then let’s see whether the thoughts of the EU will hold any water. However, you may wish to know that the EU parliament has passed several resolutions like the US Congress for which Ambazonians are awaiting full implementation.
Recall also that the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, suggested resolving these conflicts immediately after that in Ethiopia. While our people die, we have to wait for ours to be brought to the front burner. Mind you, our people are peace-loving and conscious people from Enugu, through Foumban to Banjul.


Where are you with the negotiations with the government?
As of now, we are not into any negotiations with the Cameroun government. We met with them twice in 2020 and tabled some Confidence Building Measures that would create the Avenue and conducive atmosphere for the way forward to TALKS and Negotiations. We are ready to join the call for a ceasefire and open the door for negotiations.
These measures include:
a) Mr. Biya should declare the Ceasefire by removing his military and forces from our streets and villages;
b) Free all persons arrested and detained in connection with this conflict;
c) Grant free access to all our people in the Diaspora to be able to return without fear of being arrested, tortured, or secretly detained;
d) The LRC government should Commit to an international Mediation with our people, in a neutral venue mutually agreed upon.

Be assured that we are ready and shall present a formidable team, selected by Ambazonians and not any hand-picked members.

We are urging the international community to persuade Mr. Paul Biya to agree to resolve this conflict in the only way possible, under internationally prescribed conflict resolution principles and procedures.


Do you think there could be a new dialogue?

All we know is that an army has never defeated a people in their land, not to talk of a determined and committed people like Ambazonians. The conflict will end where it was supposed to begin – on a dialogue table with international mediation between the government of La Republique du Cameroun and the people of the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia.
However, if Mr. Paul Biya continues to display this inconsiderate move of sending his people as military to our land, the regrets on their families will continue because ultimately no one can truly compensate the families of fallen soldiers, talk less of those involved in a senseless genocidal war. Mr journalist, have you people visited our land, to find out about life from the families, victims of this man-made disaster?
Despite the sweat, pain, tears, blood they endure, most say «give us liberty and freedom or go our death». How can you defeat such a people? No one is more difficult to defeat than one who is ready to sacrifice everything, including his/her life, for a cause.


Today Ambazonian leaders are accused of embezzlement. What reaction does this elicit in you? How can funds destined to defend a cause take other paths? Doesn’t that discredit your fight?

It is painful and pathetic indeed to hear that some leaders have gone down that route. We frown at all corrupt practices no matter how small. Our dream is to develop and make Ambazonia, a jewel in the Gulf of Guinea, Africa, and the world. This can be achieved only when we shun corruption.
As of now, we are trying to build institutions that, going forward, are driven by a high sense of responsibility, accountability, and transparency. Thus, we are calling on all Ambazonians to join hands to achieve this noble goal that will make financing the revolution easier and more credible.
We also call on those using the restoration struggle for personal aggrandizement to desist from it going forward. They should be reminded that there will be a day of reckoning when we get home. The Ambazonian people shall hold their leaders accountable everywhere and at all times.
There is no immunity and dictatorship or such phrases as “high instructions of the head of state”. So all those handling the peoples’ funds will in time be judged and if found guilty, such persons will be conscripted to refund the money with penalties. However, there is no war without deviants. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were early examples.



With massive embezzlement, insults and counter-insults, and the impending disintegration of the group you led before your arrest, do you think you can stop this group from further disintegrating?

Hardly can you cite a house or even a revolution without divisions. Don’t you disagree with your partner at home? Have you not read of worse instances in history of these elements as pitfalls in revolutions? Did Miriam and Aaron not oppose Moses? Our case and cause are not unique.
The good thing with the divisions we see in the Ambazonian quest is that we all have a common focus and purpose, which is getting to Buea. The differences you see are cosmetic and will in time disappear. These divisions slow us down but with increasing communication among us, especially with the facilitation of the Centre for Dialogue and Negotiation (CDN) to foster mutual respect, our differences are reducing.
On this subject, we call on all Leaders of our Restoration cause, to communicate more with one another and build bridges that enhance collaboration for the sake of our suffering people. If there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.
Our team is working tirelessly to collaborate with all movements and groups involved in this struggle.
We call on the Ambazonian people to remain resolute, steadfast, courageous, and determined. Even though this war was imposed on us, our people are resolute and steadfast.
We can resolve this conflict and become better or necessary neighbors like the USA and Canada or pay a blind eye and further live like Israel and Palestine. The choice is LRC’s and don’t forget that in life you make your choices and eventually your choices make you.

We seize this opportunity to extend our New Year greetings to our people and the people of this world.

The world will be a better place if each and everyone contributes his/her potential. Thank you

0,"Ambazonia kingpins display unity, maintain independence goal","November 7, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Some recent events have indicated that there is more collaboration and agreement among separatist ringleaders, barely a few days after the just ended CDN convened internal dialogue.

This is seen in recent releases from three segments of The Ambazonia struggle, namely the Bafut 7 Kata, the Interim Government (IG-Care), and The Terminators of Ambazonia (TTA), signed by Gen. Suh Fuh, VP Dabney Yerima, and Judson McSikod respectively showing agreement.

Contained in all three releases are common outcomes like debunking the singing of Cameroon’s anthem or any such equivalence during the retreat, full support for the absolute independence of Ambazonia, agreements to the Swiss-led multi-mediated negotiation process amongst others.

In the IG release signed by VP Dabney Yerima, the Ambazonia leaders informed the International Community that “As a people, we prefer to be addressed as Southern Cameroons or Ambazonia, not North West and South West regions of Cameroon.”

While noting that “ We are NOT the political opposition to the government of Mr. Paul Biya”, Yerima adds that the leaders are focused (Decisions and Actions) only on offering the people of Southern Cameroon what they want, “Absolute Independence”.

The IG will issue a final detailed report as regards the Toronto conference in the coming weeks, said VP Dabney.

0,"Anglophone crisis is legitimate, Ambazonia is illegitimate – Dr. Nkongho Success","October 2, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Repentant separatist, Dr. Nkongho Success has said the armed conflict in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon will continue to cause more loss of lives if the belligerents do not sit at the dialogue table.
Talking to MMI within the context of October 1 – the Independence Day of the former British Southern Cameroons, he said politicians with ill intentions are responsible for the prolonged armed conflict. To him, the only way out is for both parties to look past their personal interests.
Excerpts:
You used to be a separatist and then turned against them and joined the Cameroon government. Where do you stand today with regards to the ongoing conflict?
I stand as a mediator. I try to preach to both parties that guns cannot stop the crisis. We need people to sit and talk. Whether they like it or not, one day they will do that.
 What does October 1st mean to you?
My perspective about October 1st is that it is a day Anglo-zonians and Yaounde-zonians use to incite violence, using Ambazonia as a pretext for political purposes.
What would your advice be to both the government and separatists with regards to the upcoming October 1st celebrations?
I will advice government not to try to distort the history of Southern Cameroons. At the same time, I will advise separatists to align themselves with the rules of government and the constitution of Cameroon. If they want to change anything, they should get into politics and get elected. From there, they can change things.
You encouraged fighters to drop their weapons and go to the DDR centers. How has that government initiative been going? Is it yielding fruits?
Yes and no. First of all, the DDR initiative from the head of state is a very good idea. Unfortunately, politicians, I refer to as Ango-zonians and Yaounde-zonians have used DDR for personal interest and that explains why it is a failure. DDR is a failure because politicians hijacked it to bring in their own ideas … On the other hand, the disarmament process is a success because thousands of fighters have been disarmed and deradicalized.
Nambere and Yanick Kawa Kawa were among some of the top fighters who left the Armed struggle and started fighting for peace. Nambere has made public allegations that he is being targeted for assassination by some members of the government and Kawa Kawa was recently arrested for dealing in illicit sale of fuel. Does that mean there is no reintegration for ex-fighters?
Everyone who is advocating for a genuine solution is an enemy to the Yaounde-zonians and Anglo-zonians. They seek to eliminate everyone who wants genuine solutions to this crisis. I am an example, Nambere is an example. We are not accusing the government. We are accusing certain members of the government who we refer to as Yaounde-zonains and anglo-zonains, those who are drawing huge benefits from this crisis. They are the ones that do not want to see some of us alive.
 Is president Paul Biya aware these people exist within the system?
Yes. I am sure President Paul Biya has an idea that these people are having a hand. When you give a case for someone to manage and after five years the case escalates, it is enough for you to know that this person lacks competence or is an accomplice to the enemy. With the wisdom that God has given President Paul Biya, he is aware that there are people in his government who are actually the ones fueling this crisis. We know that the man is very slow to action, he takes his time to do his things and he will do it at the right time. He will take the necessary action on those we are accusing of being Yaounde-zonains and anglo-zonains at the right time.
What would you propose that will lead to a long-lasting solution to the conflict?
I propose an immediate ceasefire, amnesty to all the separatist fighters and separatist activists at home and abroad. I also propose strongly, a national reconciliation conference within which there will be genuine dialogue. Guns cannot stop this crisis; men can stop it without the use of guns.
The people have lost faith in both the separatists and the Cameroon government. Do you think both sides can be trusted given that they do not seem to care about the population?
Even among husband and wife sometimes they don’t trust one another. But when they begin to do things that can build back the trust, the trust returns. If the government and separatists begin to do the right thing, the trust will return.
People are always wary of persons who cross carpets. Do you think the government of Cameroon currently trusts you?
Absolutely yes… do you know of some government ministers who were part of the coup d’etat against President Paul Biya who are members of the government today? Does Paul Biya trust them? If yes, then he trusts me too.
The crisis started due to grievances on the part of lawyers and teachers. To date, proponents of the breakaway state of Ambazonia believe that nothing has been done. What do you think about the grievances of the English-speaking population? 
The Anglophone crisis is legitimate, Ambazonia is illegitimate.  Let us put aside Ambazonia, it is a scam. Talking about the Anglophone crisis, our people have been marginalized. Our system has been francophonised. There is injustice and discrimination. It has to stop. There is supposed to be fairness, justice, and equality.
How can this change be concretely materialized?
The national cake should be divided equally. Some people should not have a bigger share and others should be picking crumbs from the ground. The national cake should be divided equally. Once that is done other things will follow like justice. There should be equality in the judicial system. There should be equality in appointments… Once that is done, you don’t need to preach to people to drop down their guns. For instance, if you revive the Besongabang airport, do you know how many thousands of Manyu sons and daughters will have jobs? Do you need to preach to them to drop down their guns at that point? You don’t need that.
If you revive the Tiko airport, do you know how many people will have jobs? You don’t need to preach to them. Their consciences will preach to them by themselves. There are a lot of things we need to sit on and restore so that everybody will see that they belong to this family called Cameroon. If everybody has that sense of belonging, then nobody would want to divide the country.

Bali is one of the pivots is the ongoing Southern Cameroon war of independence in the North West Region of Cameroon.

Sources say the gunfire started when the separatist fighters arrived the Ntafoang Grand Stand in Bali. Government forces stationed at the Court Yard around the Fon’s Palace opened fire, prompting a response from the separatist fighters.

No one was hurt on the side of the fighters, a source said.

October 1 In Bamenda Town And Its Environs

There were no major activities in the town of Bamenda as heavily armed men in uniform were stationed at all road junctions, major streets, in the quarters, hiden corners of the town, roof top of story buildings, just to name but these.

They had just one mission, which was to frustrate the activities of Pro Independence fighters geared towards celebrating what they say is their independence day.

“This caused many to stay indoors, we got information via an audio mesaage that, those who can celebrate should go out and celebrate and that those who would not be able should stay indoors reason why we stayed indoors,” a Bamenda denizen told MMI

The usual hoisting of flags was some how absent as well. We however received information that, the Ambazonian flag colors were printed on the tar in some areas of the town.

The heavy military deployment caused many to stay indoors. No business place was opened, no commercial motor bikes and the yellow taxis especially in the Sub Divisions were visited.

Places are now calm, as many of the soldiers have all retired home, MMI gathers.

Many are happy that the streets were not painted with people’s blood as had been the case some years back.

0,“We are going to destroy the shackles and burden that Yaoundé has placed on Ambazonia” – Paul Nilong,"October 1, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"As Southern Cameroonians and activists celebrate what they believe to be the day of Independence of Ambazonia, October 1st, Mimi Mefo Info spoke to Paul Nilong, the Media Outreach Coordinator for the Department of Self Defense and Security of the Interim Government of the “Federal Republic of Ambazonia” to get the IG’s views on the significance of October 1st to the people of the Southern Cameroons.

“La Republique du Cameroon,” he says “From the onset has wanted to destroy the value and importance of October 1st.” He claimed. Paul Nilong maintained that the significance of the date is being wiped out from history by the system in Cameroon given that none of it has ever been taught or included in the pedagogic curriculum of Cameroon.

“We were given fictitious dates of 20th May and 11th February and taught to uphold a unitary state that died a long time ago,” Paul Nilong declared.

As part of the Sako Ikome led Interim Government, charged with the burden of adhering to the needs of anglophone refugees now in Nigeria, Paul Nilong admitted that it nevertheless was never planned to have Southern Cameroonians become refugees in another country.

“… we planned to protect and secure the lives of our people after having over 300 villages burnt and 30,000+ others murdered,” he says. “Take note however that we are at war, and these are some of the effects encountered during such periods which our people will have to bear. We believe that order will return one day and we will rebuild our country again,” he assured.

Paul Nilong went a step further to emphasize that the struggle at the moment aims to “Make Ambazonia ungovernable… We don’t care whether Yaoundé breathes or not, we are going to destroy the shackles and burden that Yaoundé has placed on Ambazonia,” he declared.

Achieving this, Paul Nilong pointed to the increasing firepower of the Separatists fighters which he says has grown from strength to strength over the past five years.

“Yesterday we started this revolution with catapults and sticks, then to Dane guns, then AK-47s… Now we have modified IEDs and we equally own a rocket launcher already,” he boasted. “Our IEDs have been modified to create heavy impact. You see them yourselves what they can do, and it will continue thus until Yaoundé gives up the fight,” he insisted.

Quizzed about the recent lockdown of 2 weeks imposed in the English-speaking regions, Paul Nilong said it was a show of strength and to pass a message to the Yaoundé regime on “Who controls things in Ambazonia”, he revealed.

Commenting on the situation of schools in the Anglophone Regions, Paul Nilong said the Interim Government had never denied schools from operating in the Anglophone Regions.

“We have merely warned the parents of children and told them that their security is not guaranteed… About a month ago, a 9-year-old was shot in a class by the military in Kumbo. That’s why we insinuate that there is no security for schools to be operational.”

The Interim Government through Paul Nilong believes that the conflict can be resolved on dialogue, but with the conditional presence of a third and neutral party.

“Third-party negotiation is all there is, and we’re waiting for La Republique du Cameroun in Switzerland.”

0,“We are going to destroy the shackles and burden that Yaoundé has placed on Ambazonia” – Paul Nilong,"October 1, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"As Southern Cameroonians and activists celebrate what they believe to be the day of Independence of Ambazonia, October 1st, Mimi Mefo Info spoke to Paul Nilong, the Media Outreach Coordinator for the Department of Self Defense and Security of the Interim Government of the “Federal Republic of Ambazonia” to get the IG’s views on the significance of October 1st to the people of the Southern Cameroons.

“La Republique du Cameroon,” he says “From the onset has wanted to destroy the value and importance of October 1st.” He claimed. Paul Nilong maintained that the significance of the date is being wiped out from history by the system in Cameroon given that none of it has ever been taught or included in the pedagogic curriculum of Cameroon.

“We were given fictitious dates of 20th May and 11th February and taught to uphold a unitary state that died a long time ago,” Paul Nilong declared.

As part of the Sako Ikome led Interim Government, charged with the burden of adhering to the needs of anglophone refugees now in Nigeria, Paul Nilong admitted that it nevertheless was never planned to have Southern Cameroonians become refugees in another country.

“… we planned to protect and secure the lives of our people after having over 300 villages burnt and 30,000+ others murdered,” he says. “Take note however that we are at war, and these are some of the effects encountered during such periods which our people will have to bear. We believe that order will return one day and we will rebuild our country again,” he assured.

0,"Bamenda: Government soldiers shoot dead two repentant Ambazonian fighters, injure another","September 27, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"There is shock and consternation at the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintergration Center, DDRC in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon following the shooting to death, of two repentant fighters. The incident reportedly took place on Sunday September 25, 2021.

Though events leading to the shooting remain unclear, sources say the incident happened at a renowned hotel at the Old Town neighborhood in Bamenda.

“They shot three, two are dead and one is under intensive medical care,” a source told MMI.

Reports say anger could be seen written all over the faces of the other ex-fighters — with no one “able to tell what may be running through their minds.” The government has not yet issued a statement.

The center was created some years back by the Biya regime to accommodate former Separatist fighters who have dropped their weapons.

Many however have criticised the initiative, stating that it fails to adequately meet the needs of repentant separatist fighters. Others think a DDR centre can only be created after the bloody conflict in the country’s English-speaking regions has ended.

In a eulogy rolled out of his detention cubicle at the Kondengui Principal Prison Yaounde Wednesday, 18 August 2021, AyukTabe said when they learnt of the passing of Mr Christian Penda Ekoka ten days ago, they were filled with sadness.

“On behalf of my people, and in my name, I extend our profound condolences to his immediate family and to the larger community he created through his activism within ACT/AGIR,” wrote AyukTabe.

He said in the nine months that Penda Ekoka spent at the Yaoundé Principal Prison, they got to know him.
“The memory of him and his teammates in the prison courtyard, where we met to pray, exercise, eat, relax or meditate, lingers on,” AyukTabe wrote.

“He came across as a rigid, stern, decisive, reserved, unbiased administrator and politician. At all times, his intellect and technical mastery was on display. He was soft-spoken, especially while gazing eyeball to eyeball for frank talks. Even where and when we disagreed, we did so respectful of each other.”

AyukTabe furthered: “We learnt and appreciated his keen interests, concerns and personal sacrifices to ameliorate the living-conditions, empowerment and liberty of his country-people from their plight. We understood how some of his stances made him incompatible with palace crew and colleagues.

“His death must leave a huge vacuum and an unwavering legacy. We join in prayers that those whom he has mentored through ACT/AGIR and through his other partnerships will carry his mission further.

“May his family, friends and community be granted the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
“Adieu dear friend Christian Penda Ekoka. May you journey well into God’s heavenly kingdom and find rest.”

0,Ambazonia fighters kill two civilians in Small Babanki,"August 5, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"For the last three days, Kejom Ketinguh (Small Babanki), a village in Tubah Subdivision, North West region has been witnessing a tense atmosphere following the killing of two civilians on August 1, 2021.

Maneh Mohvuh and Wondoh, natives of Small Babanki, were tagged as blacklegs and executed by armed separatists.

Maneh is reported to have dressed in military attire and led a contingent of soldiers into Babanki to locate houses and bases of Ambazonia fighters.
Separatists say the soldiers placed Maneh ahead to lead them to a house where some fighters were hiding. As he broke the door, the fighters rained bullets, killing him on the spot. The soldiers are said to have taken to their heels after the incident.

A reinforcement of Ambazonia fighters reportedly arrived the scene and an examination of the corpse identified him as “a civilian who was wearing a military attire and a blackleg.”

“His phone was taken and going through it, one of his friends called Wondoh it was revealed had been the one who alerted him to lead thé soldiers into the village,” said a source familiar with the story.

That same night, Wondoh was picked up and killed by the Ambazonian fighters.

“The two blacklegs have been working with the Cameroon government and the elected member of parliament for Tubah and Bafut, Aghor Oliver who hails from Small Babanki,” a separatist stated.
Sources say Ambazonian fighters in Tubah and Small Babanki have promised hard times to all those siding with state forces.

0,Ambazonian ‘General’ No Pity Promises “Havoc” After Soldiers Arrest Family,"August 3, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"By Tata Mbunwe
Dreaded Ambazonian ‘General’ No Pity has threatened he will cause “havoc” if Government fails to release his family members whom he says were arrested by soldiers this Tuesday morning.

The dreaded fighter, who controls a separatist base known as Marine Forces located in Ndop, Cameroon’s Northwest Region, says government should “leave my family and face me.”
“I give the government 48 hours and you will start receiving bad news, because I’m going to cause havoc,” he said in an audio voice note circulated on social media platforms early on Tuesday.

Stating that this is not the first time Government is targeting family members of separatist fighters, he said soldiers should free his family and face him.

“At dawn today, August 3, Cameroonian soldiers stormed our compound. they arrested my uncles, aunts, my younger brothers and sisters…,” he said, adding that “that does not move me because I know what to do.”

“I want you to know that, if anything bad happens to my family, I will make you cry more than ever. I will visit Bafoussam, I will visit Douala but I will start from Ndop”.

After launching some of the fiercest attacks against Cameroonian soldiers in the Northwest Region in recent weeks, No Pity says he is solely responsible for his actions and his family has nothing to do with what he has been doing.

“Who told you my parents were the ones who sent me into this fight? They didn’t ask me to fight; It was my decision. Stop chasing Ambazonian fighters’ parents; face the fighters themselves.”

There is yet no official information from the government concerning the arrest of the fighter’s family.
There has been a recent surge in attacks against government forces in the Northwest and Southwest regions, with several soldiers losing their lives in explosives detonated by separatist fighters.

Government also claims to have neutralised several separatist militia, and both sides claim to be winning in a conflict that has left over a million Anglophone Cameroonians displaced with more than 4,000 losing their lives since 2016, according to information from humanitarian groups.

There have been several calls from international bodies for dialogue and ceasefire, including the Catholic Church which opted to mediate in a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

0,Dieudonné Essomba Predicts Ambazonian secession should Government persist with ‘futile strategy’,"June 28, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The outspoken Economist and Statistician has publicly lambasted the Cameroon Government’s handling of the Anglophone crisis and has warned that Anglophones are going to separate from Cameroon if Government insists on using violence in solving the crisis.
Speaking at Vision 4’s Club d’Elites program, Dieudonné Essomba categorically said that the government at present does not have the economic, financial, political and strategic means amongst others to fight the secessionist movement that has now brewed for four whole years.
The economist also blamed the armed conflict on Government’s sturbonness and unwillingness to listen to the Anglophones when the crisis began in 2016, and later on sending the military there mostly made of francophones.
“When we are in a Unitary State and then you send the military to a zone like the Anglophone regions, that army appears exactly as an opposition to the people. In this case you can’t see Anglophones whose children are in the bushes collaborate with these forces to kill the separatists. It is inconceivable,” he said
“Anglophones sitting in their region, with their children in the bushes become faced with Beti’s whom they don’t know, Fulbe’s dressed in military attire and we expect them to collaborate with them against their own people. How is that even possible?” He added.
Dieudonné Essomba maintained that the present Unitary State has been an utter failure and must be revised if the Government wants to save and maintain the unity of Cameroon.
“Anglophones are no longer with the Unitary State. They have absolutely no interest in it anymore. What the Government has to do is to sit together with them and propose an alternative system which to me should be at least a Confederation…Africa has had 4 countries which were formerly Federal states but abandoned it; There is Ethiopia-Eritrea. Ethiopia abandoned the Federal system and Eritrea left. Same thing with Somaliland and Sudan. When a States leaves from the Federal Union, the other secedes completely. The Fourth one is Cameroon. If we are not careful, the Anglophones will go,” he said.

0,Ambazonian Diaspora Leaders call for tougher U.S. sanctions on Cameroon,"June 17, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The Ambazonian Coalition Team dubbed ACT has applauded a recent decision taken by the government of the United States to impose visa restrictions on individuals who undermine initiatives to end the crisis in Cameroon’s Northwest and Southwest regions.

In a letter penned on June 15, 2021 ACT lauded on the decision made public by the United States Secretary of States, Anthony Blinken, but added that more stringent sanctions were needed to force the Government in Yaoundé into working towards the ending of the Anglophone Crises by extending the sanctions to family members.

“We encourage the U.S to extend such restrictions to family members and to lobby American allies to impose similar restrictions as well as sanctions, including travel bans, asset freezes, arms, economic and financial embargoes and other initiatives to isolate Biya regime and it’s sponsors…,” they proposed.

The Ambazonian Coalition Team has also called on the United Nations to evoke the principle of responsibility to protect by deploying United Nations peacekeepers to the Anglophone regions to patrol a buffer zone between waring parties, which according to them will prevent Cameroonian soldiers from carrying out atrocities in the regions.

The ACT also expresses it readiness to meet with the Cameroonian Government at a possible dialogue table without any preconditions to seek for long lasting solutions to end the carnage ongoing in the Anglophone regions.

0,Ndop: Teacher urges Ambazonian IG to end Separatist violence on colleagues in Ngoketunjia,"May 25, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"A teacher in Ngoketunjia Division, North West region has in a letter addressed to the Ambazonian Leadership in the Diaspora and on ground, pleaded for an end to attacks on teachers in Ndop.

In the letter, the unidentified teacher pledged allegiance to the Ambazonian cause, but noted that teachers like him remain targets.

He adds that they have sacrificed much and are still determined to sacrifice more till the Anglophone crisis is resolved.

Read full letter below:

THREATS AND TERROR TO THE LIVES OF TEACHERS IN NDOP CENTRAL SUB DIVISION (NDOP LGA)!
ADRESSED TO:

The IG
Ambazonian Self Defense Council (ASDC),
Ngok Self Defense Council (NSDC),

Sirs,

It is with profound honour and gratitude that, I put at your disposal this observatory notes of mine on what am witnessing going on in Ndop LGA within these passed 3 weeks. After watching with dismay and consternation, I decided to caption it:”TEACHERS ON HARM’S WAY IN NDOP”.


Truly, teachers are living and partly living in this section of SC aka Ambazonian! I’m a retired school teacher with the MISSIONS, now on retirement, and a 100% supporter of Southern Cameroons Statehood. Caught in this PRECARIOUS circumstances in Ndop, I must say what I see.


After all, even the Bible says: “The truth shall set you free”. So, the God of Ambaland shall keep me and us all safe in our actions and convictions.


Permit me make these preliminaries here. At the dawn of this revolution in November 2016, teachers via their respective Trade Unions, castigated the betrayal of the Anglo-Saxon system of education by the Yaounde regime characterised by Francophones and some of the so-called Anglophone elites. In this domain, teachers stood for the revolution with all their energy.


Even in 2018 when Mr Biya declared war on Southern Cameroonians, and changed a revolution with peace plants, into a full-fledged war, I’m double sure that teachers have been for the revolution if not by holding guns, but through other diplomatic means that can’t be overemphasized here for technical factors.


Therefore I wish to say here categorically that, teachers are with and for the revolution till Ambazonia gets what its yearning for, from the dictatorial Bulu_Beti regime of Etoudi.

Dearest sirs, let me delf into the crux of the matter. From the IG to the different Self Defense machineries of the IG, teachers had and are answerable to them whatever the circumstances. They respect the Mondays Ghost Towns, strategically implemented Lockdowns, and every bit of instructions that could propel our God ordained struggle.

Most of the teachers had no optional activities before, during and even after this revolution than teaching. It’s a profession they embraced and it’s their sole source of livelihoods. I’m equally certain that for the economy of Ndop to sometimes be partially relieved during this war, it’s thanks to the largesse of teachers(whether missions, private or public).

A teacher is, a teacher! Some say public schools are functioning in Ndop LGA, That’s a blatant lie sirs! Are students on campuses in Ndop LGA? The unique response is, “NO”. Then, why attacking teachers in the name of public schools? Are we not indirectly or directly harming our own and thwarting the actual tenets of this revolution?

Or does the IG acknowledge what’s ongoing in Ndop in recent weeks? In 3 weeks now more than 6 teachers have been arrested by the RFs of Ndop LGA under the Command of the GENERAL in charge of the said LGA with heavy fines of 2-3 million paid by the victimized teachers.

Let’s be clear here, the IG says teachers can’t go to school due to lack of security. Yes, teachers of public schools aren’t going to schools in Ndop. Is this not a heavy respect to the IG’s Orders? Surely, yes.
However, after some Ngoketunjia elites from Ndop calculated new methodologies to sap money from the Yaounde administration, manœuvred and created what they call CATCHMENT CENTRE at the Ndop Courtyard.

Teachers in Ngoketunjia as a whole and Ndop to be precised started getting threats from the colonial SDO, DOs and their cronies to go and resume work at the said centre. They added teachers who failed to get there would be arrested and jailed.

Except our brothers and sisters, home and in the diaspora wanted these poor and desperate teacher’s death, which I don’t guess so! These teachers used to pass around the place in hidings to append their names at the level of the offices of colonial officials, for fear of the unknown from Biya’s terrorist forces under the SDO of Ngoketunjia.

Remember, teachers of public schools who were coming from the Francophone regions from the onset, championed these mass exodus to the NDOP CATCHMENT CENTRE at the detriment of those who decided to live in Ndop due to love for MOTHERLAND. As such, for fear of not being terrorised by the colonial regime in Ndop, they went and wrote their names at the CATCHMENT CENTRE.

Let’s not leave the object and, haunt the shadow! If the IG doesn’t call the said GENERAL to order, am sure teachers who are a majority of the population in Ndop now shall pack their luggage and leave Ndop! At that moment, we shall know that, the IG drove them out of Ndop through the “tigritudes” of this particular General.

Should I say General FIRE understood and felt for the teachers plight? Any rational Ambazonian can call Ndop and judge for themselves! We’re at war, we ultimately know that we must follow the dynamics of war, but not to the point of no survival though. But, let’s our God ordained struggle not change paradigm in Ndop to witchhunting!
Note, the voice of a suffering peoples (masses), is the voice of God. We know in the shortest possible time, our most cherished IG, in compliance with the Ngoketunjia Self-defense Bodies, shall seek lasting remedies to this situation teachers in Ndop are facing.

While we remain resilient and resolved to orders from the IG and ASC, I know these our teachers shall still be useful to us in our future Ambazonian New Republic, God be our Guardian Angel

LONG LIVE NDOP SELF-DEFENSE,

LONG LIVE RESTORATION COUNCIL,

LONG LIVE THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT, AND
LONG LIVE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF AMBAZONIAN
THANKS. 24th /5/2021.

0,"“We have not given up. Our quest for a free, independent Ambazonia is beyond us” – Sisiku Ayuk Tabe","March 13, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The incarcerated President of Ambazonia sat down in an exclusive interview with French Magazine, Jeune Afrique Yesterday March 12, 2021, where he gave out some surprising remarks and revelations concerning the current Anglophone Crisis in the Northwest and the Southwest Regions.

Sisiku Ayuk Tabe was sentenced to life in prison by the Yaoundé Military Tribunal as the leader of the Ambazonian quest for independence in the nearest future.

He was arrested and illegally extradited to Cameroon from Nigeria, a collaboration which governments of both countries hoped will quell any further hopes for self determination from respective fugitive clans (Ambazonians in Cameroon and Biafrans in Nigeria).

Talking to Jeune Afrique, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe was fully defiant of the hopeless believe that his arrest was going to hamper the determination of Southern Cameroonians to drive for Independence.

“We have not given up: our quest for a free and independent Ambazonia is beyond us and if detention is the price to pay then so be it,” he said.

The Ambazonian leader in his outing has made it clear that Independence is the ultimate goal of the struggle, but that however there must be a peaceful coordination of activities from both sides.

He mentioned that it will be vital that there be a ceasefire in the regions, something which he says the Government has shown extreme bad faith in achieving so far.

“Let me remind you that there have already been calls for a ceasefire, including last year, but Paul Biya does not respect them. Note also that there was never any question for Ambazonia to oppose the Cameroonian government by violence. We only defended ourselves against an occupying army. The proof is that there was no act of violence in the French-speaking part of Cameroon. We have never led an offensive outside our territory. As soon as Paul Biya has declared a cease-fire and that he has committed to the four points that I have listed for you, we assure you that the violence will stop” he stated.

The former leader was equally quizzed on possibilities of a potential Dialogue between the Government and the Ambazonian Leadership.

He noted that the Ambazonian Leadership will always remain open for negotiation with the government provided the government withdraw its troops from Ambazonia and adhere to a ceasefire amongst other things.

“Before any discussion, we ask Paul Biya to withdraw his army from our streets, to release all political prisoners, to grant a general amnesty to members of the diaspora and to accept international mediation, in a neutral place. If these prerequisites are met, then Ambazonians will be ready to dialogue. Otherwise, Paul Biya will monologue without us”.
He also castigated the Major National Dialogue held Yaounde some two years ago, calling it a meeting between Biya and some friends which had nothing to do with the quest of Ambazonia.
Talking about some rumours that spread sometime last year of talks being held behind the curtains between them and some government emissaries to negotiate a ceasefire, Sisiku affirmed that there were indeed talks, but that they could not continue because the Government were not ready to fulfill their own conditions for a ceasefire.

Taking a deep and introspective look at the impacts of the crisis ever since it began in 2016, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe also added that at this point a Mandated UN Mission to investigate the human and material damage caused by the crisis is of utmost importance above all things.

“As we speak, several reports claim that over 32,500 civilians have been killed. More than 1 million children are out of school, more than 550 villages have been razed and more than 3,000 people are in prison. Hundreds of our women and girls have been raped, thousands of our loved ones are missing. The Norwegian Refugees Commission has declared, two years in a row, that it is the least publicized crisis in the world, which is obviously linked to the fact that the Cameroonian government is preventing independent investigators from coming on the ground. A mission mandated by the UN is therefore absolutely necessary to reveal the gravity of the atrocities committed,” he concluded.

The modus operandi on such instances, according to this lady, is that these fighters term anyone they find with a National ID card as blackleg and therefore result in abusing them.

The downside of this, she explains, is that without this National ID card, Anglophones equally fall into major trouble with the military. As such, innocent civilians are caught up between two extremes.

In her testimony, this anonymous lady narrates that she was plunged into this dilemma which she just luckily maneuvered out of.

“I was traveling to Bamenda and when we got a place between Kumbo and Jakiri, we met a group of ground zero fighters who were extremely well-armed. I don’t know what faction they belonged to. They came to us to carry out control. What I had with me was an ID card receipt which I had carried for the past 3 years. I recently renewed it. So when I showed it to them one of them asked me to come down, that I was a blackleg. So I came down and tried to explain to them the situation. I told them if I didn’t have that ID card, I would be in trouble with the police.
“They won’t let me travel and equally if I don’t have this ID card, you withholding me here will call me a spy. Moreover, you guys have got no identification papers through which we can identify ourselves when traveling. If you have one you tell me and I’ll produce them,” she told him.

Our informant explained to us that her pleadings all fell on deaf ears as the armed men insisted that she was a blackleg. She luckily got bailed by the driver of the vehicle. The driver mediated on her behalf successfully, after which she was asked by these fighters to pay a penalty of 1,000FCFA which she did and set free.

However, the victim is crying out to the Ambazonian Leadership both in Cameroon and Abroad as well as the state to look into the issue of Identification in the Anglophone regions to spare innocent civilians from these daily harassments.

“It is really becoming a burden for us to bear. If you extend your ID card, you get into trouble with the Ambazonians, if you don’t, then you fall into trouble with the military. Finally, what do they want us to do? Please I just wish to plead that these boys on ground zero be told that they don’t have Independence yet and so don’t have any official documents with which to Identify their own people. Let them at least let us have what we have and move freely. They are making life unbearable for innocent civilians,” she pleaded.

0,Buea: Ex-Ambazonia fighters rubbish government promises,"February 1, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"It has been a tense Monday, February 1st, 2021 at Bokwango village Buea, Capital of the South West region of Cameroon.

Former Ambazonia fighters blocked the road with the use of blanks and stones. On why the boys left their Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration -DDR Centre in Buea to the street in protest, one of them says, “We are tired of government’s unfulfilled promises of giving us jobs to make a better life. This is the major thing they promised to us when we were fighting in the bushes for the restoration of the state of Ambazonia. Several months after we laid our arms and came to this center, it’s from one promise to another”.

To the ex-fighters, their families lavish in abject poverty while government shows no good faith in creating jobs as she promised.

Besides not creating employment opportunities for the boys that held guns against the government of Cameroon in the past, they also decry poor living conditions in the center.

To them, the feeding and other social conditions in the center are unacceptable. “…we are not happy living there again. We want to get back to normal life in the society ” One of the boys stated.

The director of DDR Centre Buea, as well as Dr. Mohamadou, secretary-general at the South West governor’s office, the divisional officer of Buea subdivision, Abba Abdouraman and defense officials, have held a meeting with the boys in the area of their protest.
They tried convincing them to return to the DDR center but they retorted “we want everything discussed here. We are tired of promises in the office.”

The protest of the ex-fighters comes as a surprise to some Cameroonians given that the boys recently uploaded videos and pictures of themselves depictin living a good life in the center.
To some observers, the videos were mere propaganda designed by the government and acted by the ex-fighters to lure and convince those still fighting in the bushes to lay their arms.

Created on the 30th of November 2018 by the president of Cameroon Paul Biya, Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration centers in Buea in the South West region, Bamenda in the North West region, and Mora in the Far North region host ex-fighters, train them in different trades then empower them financially before reintegration into the society.

0,Ayaba Cho Lucas admits Ambazonia fighters have derailed the struggle for independence,"January 27, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"For the first time since the Anglophone crisis escalated into an armed conflict in 2017, Lucas Ayaba Cho has called on separatist fighters to desist from tormenting civilians.
Ambazonia fighers have been battling with Cameroonian security forces since 2017
For the most part, government troops have been blamed for all the atrocities in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon.
However, in an audio message circulating on social media on Monday, January 25, 2021, Ayaba Cho, Commander-in-Chief of the Ambazonia Defence Forces, (ADF), regrets that armed fighters are now fighting for their stomachs.
He said the armed men are squeezing the life out of the population instead of leading the fight to create the state of Ambazonia.
“When I see a soldier die because of thuggery, stealing, I feel ashamed. Memory lost, memory wasted. I feel ashamed that brave men and women who’ve risen up to challenge Cameroon have become petit criminals trying to get food, going around harassing people, begging for food,” he said. “I do not only feel ashamed, I feel angry. Anger towards such persons more than I even have anger towards La Republique. It is a disgrace.”
The ADF boss who resides in Norway says the Ambazonia fighters have long stopped fighting for the people and are rather fighting to enrich themselves.
“Mandela spent 27 years in jail, never blinked, was forced to do hard labour. The South Africans endured for more than half a century. You have guys who have been fighting for four years. They have turned themselves into petit criminals,” he said.
Ayaba adds that these fighters will be remembered only for the pain they caused the masses.
“Instead of being seen as heroes within our communities, instead of being seen as people who protect our civilians, they are being seen as tormentors. Not tormenting to get things done, tormenting to eat, to drink. How cheap some of you have become. General Ivo should be frowning and mourning,” said Ayaba. “All those great patriots, Fiango and the others should be looking at such persons with awe and disdain. It is distasteful to see soldiers falling because they are harassing the population.”
Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF) led by Ayaba Cho Lucas
Ayaba shouted: “You people haven’t got brains or what? The other day, I said I have imposed a foreign direct tax on all foreign businesses. You people are going around tormenting mothers in the villagers, even where they are burying their dead. What a sacrilege!”
He laments that armed separatists extort money even from mourning families burying their dead.
“What a sacrilege to the customs and tradition that we hold dear. What has become of some of you? What has really become of some of you? Who are you? What are you fighting for? Join la Republique army and become a tormentor. Stop giving a bad name to our struggle for liberation. Stop giving us sleepless nights every day.
“Every day you go around picking up people, transporting them, collecting money. You remember Charles Taylor? He was a warlord. He became president. You know where he is? In jail somewhere. You know Prince Johnson?”
Ayaba tells his followers that judgment day is near, and no one will be spared.
“Let me tell you something, everyone, even patriots, nationalists who spend their time tormenting the population, those who encourage, propagate torture, systematic brutality, thuggery against our own civilian population, it is a matter of time. If your body does not lie on the streets, wasted, to be eaten by vultures, the Ambazonia justice will look after you.
“No one will remember your bravery. They will only remember the torment that you instilled in the body politic of the Ambazonia society. You cannot turn a people’s war for freedom into a war of shame where every day I am being questioned by journalists about A, B or C because of criminals and irresponsibility of commanders who work within these places.
“How is it possible that you have a soldier within your camp that keeps giving your camp a bad name? On a daily basis, we do not sleep, making sure we can provide. You people should be creative, ingenious.
“The Kurds who have been fighting for more than sixty years created restaurants, the Kebab to be able to generate money. You people are going around stealing, killing people, tormenting and harassing people. It is a disgrace. And not in our name, not in the name of the Ambazonian people. It is in your name.”
Ayaba Cho’s audio was released after an Ambazonian fighter known as Tramadol was killed Bamenda due to what the AGovC leader describe as “excesses” of the fighter.
It also comes days after videos emerged of women being tortured by alleged Ambazonian fighters. It is not clear yet, what impact this will have on the fighters on the ground, given that there are several factions, with Ayaba Cho Lucas only controlling the ADF.
Unless such calls are replicated, therefore, by all the leaders of the different armed groups, it is unclear what level of impact it will have.

0,"After Mautu killings, Ambazonia leader urges UN to create fact-finding mission","January 11, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Jailed separatist leader, Ayuk Tabe has called on the UN to send a fact-finding mission to the village of Mautu in Cameroon’s South West region.

His call comes following the killing of at least ten persons in Mautu, an act that has been blamed on the Cameroon military.

Ayuk Tabe who is currently serving a life sentence at the dreaded Kondengui Principal Prison in Yaounde declared that 10 people were killed.

“Sunday, 10th Jan 2021 will go down as another dark day in the history of our nation. 10 people, including a baby, were massacred in Mautu village in Fako. We condemn these reckless killings. Violence is cowardice. The perpetrators of these acts must be brought to book,” he tweeted.

In another Tweet, he said “early witness accounts from Mautu say that the LRC military has been patrolling the village and its environs, in their trucks. However, on Sunday 10th Jan 2021, they were seen on foot in the bushes and they started the reckless shooting, killing over 10 innocent civilians”.

To him, it is essential for the UN to “… mandate a UNSC Fact-finding mission … to lay bare the truth about the genocide on our people”.

“The world,” he added, “… should remember the #NeverAgainPromise it made after the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda”.

A pro-separatist group called the 1961 Constitution has charged the government of Cameroon alongside the African football body, CAF, and world football body, FIFA for violating the independence of the Southern Cameroons state aka Ambazonia.
According to the organization, CAF and FIFA violated Southern Cameroons sovereignty by supporting the organization of the CHAN which Group D matches will be played in the South West Region city of Limbe, with Buea to host some of the Group D players.
“The entire territory of the Republic of Ambazonia is an active war zone. Foreign nationals visiting the Republic of Cameroon… should avoid entering the Republic of Ambazonia until members of the 1961 Constitution say it is safe to do so,” the group stated in a January 6th release.
They also said the government of Cameroon had no right to hold the 6th December 2020 Regional Elections in the two English-speaking regions whose sovereignty Ambazonia fighters seek.
“Of recent, the Republic of Cameroon has gone as far as organizing illegal elections on Ambazonia soil and this has been possible with the backing of their proconsuls, enablers, soldiers, and Gendarmes of the brutish military forces that rape, kidnap, behead, and dehumanize our people in many ways,” the 1961 Constitution said.
The group frowned at the Cameroon government’s neglect of some once-viable institutions in Southern Cameroons but which are inexistent today.
“Our house of Chiefs and Fons which were symbols of our cultural heritage were dissolved and today the colonizer continues to divide our people by bringing in two houses of Chiefs and Fons,” the group furthered.

0,"Ambazonian fighters intercept, burn truck in Ewili, shoot driver for resisting","January 4, 2021",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The truck driver had gone to supply sand in Ewili, a village in the outskirts of Buea in the Southwest region, and was intercepted on his way back by a group of separatists fighters.

Sources close to the truck driver say that despite the pleas he made to the separatist fighters, they denied listening and rather chose to set his truck ablaze.

After a period of arguments and disagreement, the separatists set some flames on the vehicle, but it was carefully put out by the “motor boy”. According to our informant, this angered the fighters who then aimed a shot at the young man.

“Fortunately the gun was not loaded… when he took time to load the gun, the ‘Motorboy’ fled into the bush and disappeared”. They however fired shots at the bush and the young ‘motor boy’ is believed to have been touched.

The driver who tried to take advantage of the situation to escape got shot on his arm and the truck tyres punctured with bullets and set ablaze for a second time, this time making sure the vehicle burned to ashes before they left.

“This is a real devilish thing to do. I have never seen this type of wickedness in my entire life. If next time you decide to run across them with your car when you spot them, then it will be ok because what they just did is not fair” reacts an angry inhabitant of Ewili.

The Anglophone crisis in recent periods has seen an almost dramatic shift from open confrontations between the separatist fighters and military fighters, to targeting the civilian population.

The Ambazonian Fighters like military forces have devised different methods through which they extort money and loot property from the civilians. Some who resist are either killed or locked up.

The crisis in the Northwest and Southwest regions is becoming less burdensome for the fighters on the ground and more dangerous for the neutral population.

Different factions of the splitter groups in the Northwest and the Southwest regions have promised doom for any political parties insisting on taking part at the polls in the Anglophone regions.

In a communique published on November 24 by the Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF), the central command of the group has instructed fighters to take to custody and possibly eliminate every participant of the upcoming December 6 Regional Elections, including chiefs and their councilors.
“The Chiefs and Councilors who violate the laws of the land, collaborate with the killers of our people must all be arrested or eliminated” it reads.

Ambazonian Restoration Forces have also carried out threats on social media, stating that any elections organized in the Anglophone regions would be considered an act of trespassing.

They also hinted there might be a potential lockdown to be announced in the coming days for security reasons.

Many civilians of the two Anglophone regions are at a loss at what actions they are expected to take next.
From all indications, there might be another out-flux of civilians from the Anglophone regions before the regional elections day.

Many have already anticipated a tensed atmosphere with lots of bloodshed. Recent threats by the Ambazonia separatists factions have simply come to confirm those fears.

0,Eleven repentant Ambazonia fighters presented in Buea,"November 18, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By Tata Mbunwe
Authorities in Buea have been presented 11 boys believed to be ex-separatist fighters who dropped their arms.
They are said to have denounced the ongoing armed conflict in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions.

The combatants, led by General Tiger, are reportedly from Alou, one of the separatist strongholds in Lebialem Division, in Cameroon’s restive South West region.

Before being taken to the Southwest Governor’s Office, the ex-fighters had first been taken to the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Centre in Buea, where they were disarmed and dressed in DDR T-shirts.

According to one of the repentant fighters, “the war is very dangerous and that is why I decided to stop fighting and give-up arms”.

Dozens of guns of several calibre, reportedly used by the repentant fighters, alongside iron bars and other weapons, were presented to the public.
DDR Centre Buea (MMI)

According to their leader, General Tiger, most of their friends in the camps “need just a little persuasion and assurance to drop arms”.

The fighters said nothing about warlord, Field Marshall, who has been in control of Lebialem since the start of the crisis.

There have also been reports of poor treatment of the ex-combatants at the various DDR centres in the North West and South West regions.

0,The passionate appeal of a Nso indigene to Ambazonians: Pleads for the release of the Nso people,"November 9, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"It has been days since the Paramount Fon of Nso was kidnapped by Ambazonian fighters in Ngohketunjia.
The whereabouts of HRH Fon Nsehm Mbinglo II remains a mystery. A video recently emerged in which the Fon is being interrogated, an act that goes contrary to the customs and traditions of the North West Region.
Dr Edwin Lukong is just one of the hundreds of thousands of Nso people appealing for the release of their Nso community. To him, holding the Fon is the same like holding the people of Nso hostage.
Editor’s Note
By Dr Edwin Lukong
t’s another night, another sleepless night after yet another broken hearted painful day…..Its been
I can’t sleep and as it’s been over the past 4 days, I am even struggling to think….
Like every other Nso man, my heart is bleeding…
Like every other Nso man I feel like I’m completely paralyzed 😭
And that’s not all because, I’ve got this nauseating, revolting and convulsive feelings that have all consumed me and left me in a state that is hard to define, explain or even feel……
In Nso, we say that the Fon is the people and “the people” is the Fon.
In Nso, we say that the Fon is the Truth and the strongest oath in the land is taken on the throne…..
Because the Fon is the Throne…
In Nso, we say that “Fondzenyuy” the Fon is Godly, spiritual and sacred…
In Nso, we say that the Fon is a LION – a symbol of courage and power which are imperative that Nso people should have when it relates to the Fon.
So in essence, our LION represents and reminds us of our own personal strength, courage and RESPONSIBILITIES…
(Loins are big caretakers, they all help take care of an abandoned cub…..)😭😭😭
For reasons well stated in my previous write up (the 800 eyes of the Fon), it is well enshrined in Nso tradition, Nso culture and the law of our land that:
No foreigner can talk directly to the Fon!
No foreigner can give anything directly to the Fon!
The Fon can only communicate with foreigners through an intermediary, through a very trustworthy group of Nso persons (Nchiylav)…..
We protect the Fon from EVERYTHING and WE ALL have the duty to CORRECT His mistakes!!! In Nso, we say that the Fon can never be wrong!
Because we are ALL His eyes, His voice and WE bear responsibility for His deeds!
In Nso, the Fon is an institution, not the person….
(Nso people have a SYSTEM and an INSTITUTION that can secretly and sacredly discipline the person if necessary)
Nso has been the heart and soul of Ambazonia resistance, we have lost more lives than any other tribe, more material lost than any other people, we have more Displaced persons than any other tribe and more captives in the Yaounde Kondengui prison than anyone has been able to count…..
When Hon Joe Wirba made that famous cry for freedom, that call for resistance,
He touched the nerves of Nso people by mentioning Royalty, telling us what it means to him, reminding us of who we are and opening our eyes to the desecration taking place in our land (by lr)😭😭😭
Nso people can endure economic hardship, we can deal with military brutality, with corruption, nepotism and discrimination…..
But the desecration of our traditional institutions/authority?
No, No, NOOOO!
Hon Joe Wirba knew it, he opened our eyes to it and the results are there for all to see!
The question now is, if we are fighting for Ambazonia, because LR have desecrated our land, our institutions and our identity, then how come….😭😭😭
How can Ambazonia fighters…😭
The video of “foreigners” (none Nso indigens) talking directly to the Fon😭
The thought that foreigners are giving things directly to the Fon😭
The sight of Him struggling under interrogation, under duress, probably with guns pointing Him directly on the face…😭😭
Those nauseating, revolting and haunting images are unbearable for us as a people 😭😭😭
(Yes, that’s nothing compared to the people that have been killed but it’s like slowly and painfully killing a people)
We will NEVER forget this because it is traumatisingly unforgettable 😭
We can forgive you because you don’t know what you are doing….
We have tolerated it because we are helplessly paralyzed…..
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE liberate our Fon🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
You are not holding a man captive..
You are holding Nso people, a people that have equally sacrificed everything because of your cause……..
You are holding our ancestors…
He is a symbol of who we are as a people….
And at the moment, we are helplessly begging you because we can’t even breathe🙏🏾
We are pleading with everyone fighting with and for Ambazonia to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE set our Fon free….
Kwifon is helpless…
And no Nso man worthy of his name has been able to sleep for the past 4 days!
PLEASE help us talk to anyone that can help 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This is not about a man, this is EVERYTHING to do with Nso people.
PLEASE set us free 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

0,Ambazonia Separatist fighters further desecrate NW Cultural Values: Subject HRH Fon of Nso to interrogation,"November 8, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"His Royal Highness, Fon Nsehm Mbinglo II of Nso is still in captivity after he was abducted by separatist fighters last week. The abduction of the Fon has been widely condemned as a sacrilagious act against the core customs and traditions of the people of the North West Region of Cameroon.
As if to add salt to injury, the traditional ruler in a video is seen questioned by the fighters over his decision to run for the December 6 regional elections despite the prevailing war situation. MMI has confirmed that the video has caused significant levels of distress among not only the Nso community but also among many sons and daughters of the North West Region.
Some have questioned if the Ambazonians have lost the sense of direction in what they term the ‘quest for freedom’. According to a NW indigene, the acts of attacking or denigrating Traditional rulers is something that ought to be condemned by all a sundry. “We claim to be fighting to restore Anglo-Saxon values, which the colonial powers imposed on us for a period of fewer than 50 years, yet we are going about destroying the foundations of our society that have existed since the beginning of time,” she tells MMI.
The Fon however maintains that he is for a unified Cameroon. His whereabouts still remain unknown at the moment. Meanwhile, the calls for his release have intensified across many circles.
Nso elites have further called on sons and daughters of the land to stop distributing the video due to its “sensitivity”.

Family members of Keumatio Ricardo say the police officer said he arrested Ricardo because he recognized him to be from Bamenda.

Having been taken exactly two months ago alongside four of his friends from a bar in Yaoundé, Ricardo has now been transferred from the police cell to the Kondengui central prison. Initially unaware of his whereabouts some days after his arrest, his relatives say he was held incommunicado for several days.

“For the first one week, we didn’t know of his whereabouts, only for us to later realize he was in a police cell. Despite our numerous visits there, they simply kept procrastinating his release which unfortunately never was” one of his relatives told Mimi Mefo Info.
Despite having offered money demanded by the police officers to bail him out, his relatives say it all went unaccounted for.

Ricardo was arrested on accounts of being recognized by a police officer in Bamenda probably as a separatist fighter but his relatives have maintained their brother has not been to Bamenda in a while now.

“It has been more than 10 years now since Ricardo last stepped his foot in Bamenda. He has been in Yaoundé ever since and sells roast meat by the roadside every evening at the Mvogbi neighborhood in Yaoundé,” we were told.

Since his arrest, Ricardo’s wife with his 9-months-old child has taken over his roadside business to keep the family running.

Ricardo has now been transferred to the Central Prison in Yaoundé without any investigations and only based on police claims with little or no proof whatsoever.
Could it be a case of a grave mistake of identity, or could it be score settlement with seriously malicious intent?

Ayeke has since 2017 been a major threat to the Cameroon military in Libialem division in the South West region.
According to a military source, Ayeke was killed by Cameroon’s military elite force known as the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) in Alou Libialem division Tuesday October 13th 2020.
To our source, the military launched a special operation targeting the the general of other militia. In the course of the operation close to a dozen fighters are said to have been killed with some hostages freed by the military. In the meantime some military men have been wounded as separatists detonated grenades.
Videos released by the military shows guns, bullets, military uniforms, shoes, bullet proofs and other military gadgets taken from the camp of the fighters situated in the forest in Libialem division.
The demise of general Ayeke, Ambazonia activists think is a great loss but not a real handicap to the struggle for independence. To pro-Ambazonia, the fallen fighter has trained many to continue the struggle.
In a 17 minutes video on the social media, the senior divisional officer of Meme Division in the South West is seen celebrating the killing of General Ayeke. Chamberlain Ntou Ndong speaking in pidgin English says ” … man pass gun. He is finish … We will touch them one by one..”

Similarly, Ambazonia leader Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, who is currently serving a life imprisonment sentence alongside nine others, says Southern Cameroonians should ensure their way of life match expectations.

“Now the important thing is that your way of life should be as the struggle requires, so that, whether or not we are able to come and see you, we will hear that you are all standing firm with one common purpose and that with only one desire, you are fighting together for the struggle of the restoration of the independence of Ambazonia,” says Ayuk Tabe.

The leader added that imprisonment has rather fostered the independence he is fighting for, as it has made people more bolder and more determined.

“… our being in prison has given most of our brothers and sisters increased determination in the struggle and more confidence in the Lord, so that they grow bolder all the time to discuss the message of the struggle fearlessly,” he said.

On his part, Samuel Sako, Interim Government leader said October 1 “marks a turning point in our nation’s history as we take charge of our destiny and lead the efforts to prosperity.

“This day of every year is not just another ordinary day in the life of our nation. This is October 1 our righfull Independence Day, a day which by all standards of legality, marks the end of colonial rule and the establishment of a free and independent Southern Cameroon.”

Although the Cameroon government says secession is “impossible” in the country, Sako has said he is hopeful the course will be attained.

“Credit me, if you may, to say that I stand this moment on the shores of our proclaimed Independence, to fill our hopes with the certainty and reality that the time comes when we will celebrate this day in honour, dignity and even in years of pride,” he says in his speech on ABC television.
Sako, AyukTabe and Ayaba Cho address Anglophone Cameroonians on October 1, 2020

October 1 this year has been exceptionally more peaceful in major Anglophone cities and towns, with streets deserted, amid fears of confrontations between soldiers and separatist fighters.

As schools are speculated to resume throughout the country this October 5, some of the separatist activists, have joined the calls for schools to resume, but this may be difficult as Ambazonia Defence Force Commander, Ayaba Cho, says no schools. This challenge against school resumption is echoed by Sisiku Ayuk Tabe who in a Twitter post, insisted that the conditions are not yet favourable for school resumption
Our vision is to provide the right education to our children. We desire to hv them go to school but would advise against them going to sch now in the midst of #Genocide by #CRM Military. They kill, rape, maim & abduct our children just bcos they're SouthernCamerooninans. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/OjbmIDkqV6
— Sisiku AyukTabe Julius -Official (@sisiku_ayuktabe) October 2, 2020

Today, Ayaba simply wrote on his Facebook Page: “Happy Independence day, resistance, resistance, resistance”.

Some Cameroonian historians hold that Southern Cameroons has never been independent, as British West Cameroon was (on October 1, 1961) only asked to join French East Cameroon or Federal Republic of Nigeria.

The separatists leaders have, however, resisted all calls against secession with Sissiku Ayuk Tabe declaring today: “In 2017, we declared it’s restoration. It is rooted in history, geography and diplomacy. Self-determination is a right. We will not cede any square inch of our homeland. Independence restored or resistance forever.”

0,Lebialem on October 1st: Ambazonian fighters ruling from the ruins,"October 1, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The much-revered October 1st is finally here. This day is considered by Ambazonians as an official day of independence for the people of the Southern Cameroons, and thus have opted to treat it like the national day, it is. The day is often marked by march-pasts and a general show of force by the Ambazonian fighters in the Anglophone regions.
Ambazonia Fighters in Lebialem
The Villagers plight
In Lebialem, one of the major strongholds of the separatist fighters, the different divides of Ambazonian leadership have chosen to mark the day in their own ways. Lebialem formerly under the sole command of Oliver Lekeaka, known popularly as ‘Field Marshall’, now has three main generals spread across its three subdivisions; Fontem subdivision controlled by the field marshal, Wabane controlled by ‘General die man’ and Alou controlled by General Ayeke. The village is surrounded by three military camps which till date have never been able to take control of it.  
A community in ruins
A buzzing village at its prime prior to the crisis in 2016 now stands like a complete shadow of itself. Inhabitants of Lebialem have complained of being cut off from the rest of the country as they neither have network nor electricity.
“Life is really hard in Lebialem, we only deal in cocoa and sell through Mamfe. Due to the crisis in the Anglophone regions and in Lebialem especially, the price has been lowered to 600frs for a kilogram of cocoa” laments farmers in Lebialem.
“Access into Lebialem is restricted and people do not even know what is going on here at any given time. If you want to call someone on phone, there are strategic spots you have to use so as to capture network”.
Surviving inhabitants of Ndumbin village in Allou say public places such public squares and markets have all been abandoned and have all turned to bushes except for the interior which is totally controlled by the separatist fighters. These inhabitants all give mandatory contributions to the Amba fighters as their own support for the struggle.
Separatists’ Dominion
In Ndumbin village, General Ayeke chose to commemorate October 1st by promoting some Ambazonian fighters under his group called ‘The Gorilla fighters of Lebialem’ to the ranks of generals and subordinates. His decision to promote them in anticipation for October 1st is reportedly due to a successful mission that was carried out that killed a good number of Cameroon armed forces. In a video shot on September 13, 2020, as the narrator of the video makes known in the presence of a curious crowd, the Amba fighters are seen making vows of commitment to completely eradicate the Cameroon military from the environs of the Lebialem division in the short run and attain the much-awaited independence.
Newly installed Ambazonian leader General Bright during his installation sent a strong warning to the Cameroon military, saying they were not going to stand on their way to independence and he would not stop unless his goal was achieved. “My mission here is to protect the civilians and take total control of our environment and to reach Buea. The military will hear from me and not me hearing from them. This is a sure mission, no retreat no surrender!” he declared confidently. Major General Ayeke of the Dragon fighters of Lebialem on his part was equally defiant of the military threats, promising to clear them off the Lebialem.
“As from today there would no more trespassing of Cameroonian soldiers here in Allou. I had information that Cameroonian soldiers move around our town going to Dschang and Menji. I am today stopping their movements. I am going to fortify my boys who will be very ready for them. The villagers will have their usual security while my boys will be on a special lookout for any trespassing military in our town. I am Major General Ayeke alias ‘man pass gun’ nobody dares me and goes free” he has threatened.
General Ayeke is the former fighter of the Red Dragons of Lebialem and the 2nd in Command of the Field Marshal. He later defected from the Red Dragons group and formed his own separatist group called the Gorilla fighters of Lebialem which now control the Allou Subdivision. There have reportedly been infightings between the Field Marshal and General Ayeke, with the latter wanting to topple Field Marshal in order to take control of the entire Lebialem. These infightings have had negative effects on the villagers as they become the suffering grass on which the two ambitious elephants fight on.

0,"Ambazonia activists divided over School resumption in NW, SW","September 28, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Ambazonia activists are visibly divided over the resumption of schools in the Anglophone regions of the Cameroon.
They have been expressing contrasting views on whether schools should resume in the North West and South West regions amidst insecurity.
Ten armed camps fighting for the restoration of Southern Cameroon(Ambazonia) in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon under the banner of Ambazonia Coalition Team(ACT) had earlier called on parents and students in the North West and South West regions to diligently respect a “a peaceful non violent boycott of school”.
In a statement issued following contrasting views about school resumption for the 2020/2021 school year, the Ambazonia Coalition Team acknowledges that children have a right to education but “…the right to equality and dignity and right to life are more important…”.
To ACT, any education in the North West and South West region of Cameroon from Yaounde is tailored to meet the aspiration of the “colonial master”.
They have described calls for school resumption as a trick from the government of president Paul Biya to water down the legitimate demands for the restoration of the statehood of Ambazonia.
Ambazonia Coalition Team challenges the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York at this time to uphold its charter and resolution by ordering the Yaounde administration to withdraw troops and UN should put in place a peace keeping mission. “Schools can only function in safe communities and restoration fighters cannot guarantee that with the presence of occupational forces from Yaounde administration”.
The stand for no school in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon has been condemned by a separatist fighter in the South West region of Cameroon. Writing to Mimi Mefo Info, the fighter we have opted to call James for security reasons says “As of now, there is no reason to stop our children from going to school. What I expect to see are possible solutions on how to sort out the issue of colonial state schools in our territory. Emphasis should be for parents to send their kids only in community, lay private and mission schools.I personally welcome the decision of school resumption as a positive move on our path”.
According to the fighter, lawyers and teachers in the North West and South West regions that started the struggled long resumed their duties and those see no reason why students and pupils should not resume school. He argues that illiteracy in the Anglophone regions in five years will likely rise following actions today.
The fighter further accused the military of attacking schools, hospital and churches and therefore called on ‘Ambazonians to device a way to stop the military from doing this.
“We can’t continue keeping our children out of school… it’s just the right decision to let kids go to school and all restoration forces should make sure there is adequate security and safety for the children who will be willing to resume school”.
A statement from the office of the President of Ambazonia governing Council states that “in areas under Ambazonia control, Community schools are ongoing under Ambazonia curriculum of education and supervised by Ambazonia Education Board. Ambazonia will again operate any institution under Cameroun”.
In the statement signed by Dr. Cho Ayaba, he condemns all calls for schools to resume in the North West and South West regions with the use of school materials from the republic of Cameroon. The governing council calls on the people to continue making sacrifices to finally get freedom; Sacrifices of staying out of school that some fighters are standing against.
According James, a fighter in the South West regions of Cameroon, “Parents are struggling to send their children to La Republigue to learn bad morals. To me all schools should be open without the teaching of French Language and the writing of CAP, BAC and Probatoire”.
As Ambazonians continue to posit contrasting views on the issue of school resumption, the government of Cameroon is finalizing measures for schools to resume in these areas despite the poor security and infrastructure.

0,Ambazonians distance themselves from back to school call,"September 28, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"There has been a controversy over school resumption in Cameroon’s restive North West and South West regions ahead of the 2020/2021 academic year. After close to four years of school boycott in these regions, where activities are paralysed by the bloody quest for the independence, some proponents of the break-away state called Ambazonian are not agreeing on kids’ should return to school. School resumption in Cameroon is slated for October 5th 2020.
In the latest release published on Friday, September 25th, 2020, members of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia, on the ground, say they have not authorized the reopening of schools.
“Ambazonia Restoration Forces (ARF) has not authorized the resumption of schools in Ambazonia,” John Egyawan, the group’s secretary of the state department of self-defence and security said.
Egyawan adds that the Interim Government (IG) and the department of Self Defense (DSS) have examined that “it is still unsafe for students and pupils to start school”.
Ambazonians deny back to school calls
“Several school-age children are killed by La Republique of Cameroun occupational forces on a daily bases. As a consequence of such heightened insecurity, it is not advisable for children to risk their lives under the false impression of security given by the colonial administration. We, therefore, encourage parents to keep their children home and where possible do homeschooling,” Egyawan went on.
This release by the Federal Republic of Ambazonia counters an earlier statement backing school resumption. Titled: “A communiqué for back to school 2020/2021”, the purported authors who called themselves, the North West and South West Restoration Fighters called for school resumption this October, stating that the purpose of the fight for independence is not to groom illiterates in the North West and South West regions.
The fighters went further to present 19-point terms that need to be fulfilled before classes can resume. One of the conditions said, “All former government schools MUST change their signpost names to community primary/secondary school X or Y etc before opening its doors”. Other conditions include no teaching of French Language and the history of La Republique du Cameroun, no singing of Cameroun national anthem nor hoisting of the green, red, yellow flag.
Calls for school resumption in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon have been made in the past despite the rising insecurity. On the 3rd of September 2020, Mimi Mefo Info published an article in which Mark Bareta, one of the front line Ambazonia activists based in the diaspora, called for schools to resume in Southern Cameroon. To Mark Bareta “The Southern Cameroon liberation struggle is not about school boycott anymore. That phase of the resistance is over”.
In the article, Mark Bareta also detailed conditions under which schools can function in the Anglophone regions. “What we have consistently said is that the right to life is more important than the right to education. As such, where the security situation permits, children should go to school. This is evident in various areas where schooling is ongoing because the security situation permits”.
The activist affirms that neither separatist fighters nor the regular military can secure kids at school. “…in areas possible, Ambazonia restoration forces should allow the schooling of children especially those that stop the singing of the colonial anthem. Monday ghost town will be respected just as periodic lockdowns when necessary,” Bareta said.
Parents, students speak out
Formal teaching and learning process has not been a reality in many localities in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon since November 2016, when school boycott calls were made. As the crisis morphed into an armed conflict in 2017 following the arrest and detention of its leaders, the desire for separation grew – government forces intensified crackdown in the regions. Today, some parents still, however, think it’s “practically impossible” for schools to restart.
A resident of Fundong, Boyo division in the North West region of Cameroon who prefers to be called Christian for security reasons, thinks any call for school resumption by the government of Cameroon or the Ambazonians is a joke. “Several schools in towns and villages in the North West and South West Regions are in a deplorable state. They are not even good for the eyestalk less of hosting students for studies. Schools burnt, destroyed and demolished have not been rehabilitated because the insecurity is still very much present,”
Christian, a parent told MMI.
He states that “no right thinking teacher can dare to resume classes in such an atmosphere”.
To a form five student in Bamenda awaiting results of Cameroon General Certificate of Education (GCE), “Last academic year, we managed to attend some classes meandering through bullets sometimes in assorted dresses to reach our schools. This can still continue in Bamenda. This is because we enjoy a minimum degree of security with the heavy presence of the military. But in other places like Batibo, Bafut, Mbengwi and villages in the divisions, I don’t think it will be possible”.
A teacher posted to government high school Menji in Libialem division in the South West region of Cameroon since 2017 has never resumed duty because of insecurity. For three years, the teacher (name withheld for security reasons) resides in Dschang in the West region of Cameroon.
He told Mimi Mefo Info on the phone that, “Am not the only civil servant that has deserted the place. Even the divisional officer does not live there anymore. When schools were suspended in March this year following the outbreak of coronavirus, I thought government and separatists will strike a deal so that schools can resume in the North West and South West regions. They did nothing, What magic do you think they can do now for schools to resume?” he questions in total frustration and disappointment.
Meantime, millions of people remain internally displaced in other parts of Cameroon while some are refugees in neighbouring Nigeria. As the government of Cameroon, Ambazonia leaders and fighters continue to speak different languages, issuing threats and counter-threats on school resumption in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, parents, guardians, students and pupils living in the restive regions remain frustrated with insufficient resources to send their kids to study in the predominantly French-speaking parts of Cameroon.

0,"Cameroon: Ambazonian Fighters Approve School Resumption Throughout Northwest, Southwest Regions","September 26, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"In what has been the longest school hostage situation ever witnessed in Cameroon, Ambazonian fighters have finally decided to relax their grip on schools throughout the Anglophone regions.
The four-year wait for effective return of schools seems to have come to an end, but not without strict conditions.
In a communiqué supposedly published by persons claiming to be the ‘Amba’ fighters and shared on social media, they stressed on the necessity of education to every child as a reason for the relaxation of the ban on pedagogic activities throughout the Northwest and the Southwest regions.
“We know that schools were one of our weapons, but we cannot leave our children to grow up as illiterates or be migrating from one country to the next in search of education, therefore, bring back all our children from foreign lands,” they write.
However, the restoration fighters have laid out stringent rules that must be followed for schools to effectively resume in the Anglophone regions unperturbed.
The conditions include:
“No Government Schools would reopen unless they change names to “Community Schools”
“Schools must respect all ghost town days
“No singing of the Cameroon National Anthem in the schools
“No teaching of French and French Cameroon History in the schools.”
“Teaching of Mother tongue languages to be encouraged”
“All schools to take adequate measures to protect students and pupils from COVID-19.”
The restoration fighters in the communiqué also threatened parents who would dare send their kids to government schools, saying any parent doing so would be accountable for whatsoever happens to their child.

0,"Appeal court verdict on Ayuk Tabe & Co.: Ambazonia Interim Government vows to respond “appropriately, forcefully”","September 18, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The Interim Government of the self proclaimed Federal Republic of Ambazonia has threatened to react “…appropriately and forcefully” to the verdict of the Centre Court of Appeal that upheld life sentences for Sisisku Ayuk Tabe Julius and nine leaders of Ambazonia.
In a statement issued Thursday, September 17, 2020 by Debney Yerima, Vice President of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia, the interim government expressed indignation over the fact that the court did not given room to defending lawyers and the legal representatives to defend their clients but summarily upheld the life in prison sentences handed down by the Yaounde military tribunal on the 20th of August 2019.
Describing the appeal court for the Centre region as a “Kangaroo Court”, the interim government says “…the court has upheld the sham judgment of the Military Tribunal of August 2019”.

To the interim government (IG), the Cameroon judicial service has not respected the verdict of the Abuja High Court in the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1st March 2019 that called for the repatriation of the leaders in detention stating that they were illegally kidnapped and taken to Cameroon.
In a release published by the communication and media committee for the defense of Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius and nine others, the presiding judge at the Centre Court of Appeal, His Lordship Mindjimba Mindjimba delivered “…the most scandalous judgment in legal history” by upholding the life in jail sentences.
In a release signed by the head of the communication and media team, Barrister Nicodemus Amungwa regrets that defending lawyers were not given the chance to defend their clients.
To him, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius and nine others have never been allowed access to their lawyers since they were sentenced at the Yaounde military tribunal on August 20th 2019.
“The judge sacrificed his integrity. It was a travesty of justice. He spoke entirely in French, a language that our clients do not understand,” Bar. Nicodemus Amungwa lamented.
The defending lawyers say the physical appearance of their clients is poor regretting that no justice can be rendered to their clients in Cameroon.
Despite what they called “scandalous judgment”, defending lawyers are already bracing up to appeal the case in the Supreme Court of Cameroon.
Sisiku Ayuk Tabe Julius and nine other leaders were “kidnapped” in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria and taken to Cameroon in January 2018 on accusations of fueling terrorism in Cameroon.

0,‘Repentant’ Ambazonia activist Success Nkongho begs Government to rescue Frankline Njume,"September 17, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Pro-government activist, Nkongho Success has expressed his support for fellow activist Njume Frankline over allegations of his job being under threats.
In a video making rounds on social media, he appears to cry saying Njume who is known for trumpeting the propaganda of the Biya regime “is sacrificing his life while others are trying to erase his existence”.
It is not really clear what trials Njume is facing at the moment, but the government apologist in a series of Facebook posts in the past days denounced ensuing tension between education officials and the Ministry of Territorial Administration.
Njume also stated that his job was at risk as a result of the conflict.
Success was a staunch supporter of the pro-independence movement in Anglophone Cameroon before crossing the carpet to the dismay of many some months back.
Njume’s Facebook page has been a tool of government propaganda and incitement of hate and violence.
The days ahead may be pregnant as we follow up on developments in and around Yaounde.

0,Locals In Pain As Ambazonia Fighters Lockdown Boyo Division After Military Raid,"September 9, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The people of Boyo Division have cried out loud against the high handedness of Ambazonian fighters operating in the division.
For close to three weeks now, the road linking Bamenda and the Division’s three subdivisions of Belo, Njinikom and Fundong have remained closed.
Separatist fighters blocked the road late last month in an attempt to frustrate a military operation that was launched by the Cameroon army in the division.
Since the military left on the 31st of August after a 6-day offensive on the fighters, the road to Boyo Division has remained closed.
Last week, the governor of the Northwest region and his entourage used the road thanks to armoured cars to Fundong and held a successful meeting in Fundong in preparation of the upcoming regional elections.
The Division that is hosting the St. Martin the Pores Hospital in Njinikom and the Mbingo Baptist Hospital is now cut off from the rest of the world.
Though few patients can make it to Mbingo, no car makes it into Belo Town and beyond.
Drugs can not reach the hospitals in time as well as fresh supplies from Bamenda.
Locals who had travelled to the Division for a holiday can’t make it back to main town Bamenda.
Patients who are suffering from non-communicable diseases managed from homes like diabetes and hypertension are at the point of near-death as drugs and insulin can’t leave Bamenda to the Division.
Even corpses can only reach the Division under cut-throat negotiations with Ambazonia fighters who extort money from the bereaved family and often impose the number of mourners to accompany the corpse.
According to Louisa Mughom, Boyo freedom fighters have graduated into real oppressors as they do not have at heart the feelings of those they say they are fighting for.
“How can they block the road for over two weeks now? How will that give them independence? I had to pay ten thousand francs ($17,95) for a bike to transport me and my daughter from Njinikom to Mbingo, a distance I can pay by car for a thousand ($1,5). Even at Mbingo, I had to pay three thousand to reach Bamenda, a distance of one thousand. Now I have to reach Yaoundé without food stuffs. The bike could not carry the corn, cocoyams and plantains I had to travel with. I’m really ashamed of my division,” she said.
Stephen Song, resident in Nkwen Bamenda narrates that his father who is a diabetic patient might soon die because of the roadblock.
“My father lives on insulin. I have to buy it each time here in Bamenda and send home. Now the stock is fast finishing and I can’t send more just because the road is blocked and for no reason”.

Ayoniaboh Pricilla could not attend the burial of her father in Fundong because of the blockade “the fighters asked that only my mother should accompany the hiace (vehicle) to the village for the burial. How can I be here in Bamenda, my father dies, and I can’t go for his burial because of people who are my liberators? It’s a shame”.
Boyo Division is one of the strongholds of the Ambazonia fighters who are much active in the Division. It was in Belo that the first attack on the para-military gendarmerie elements were launched, sowing the seed for the gun battles that have crippled the Division in all ramifications.

0,Terror in Ako as military and Ambazonian fighters battle for control of subdivision,"July 15, 2020",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Military/Ambazonia terror in Ako subdivision
Wednesday, July 15 2020 marks three days since the traditional ruler of Zembeaburu village in Ako sub division, Donga Mantung division in the North West region was kidnapped by boys who identified themselves as Ambazonian fighters.
On the basis of anonymity, a witness told Mimi Mefo Info on phone that “…the boys equally cut off the hand of a woman in Afiampara village and set ablaze a motorcycle in Abaka village”.
Separatist fighters are said to have invaded Dumbo village Monday, July 13 2020 to inflict pains on the inhabitants for permitting military men to settle there.
“The military men came to Dumbo some four months ago. They broke open a house and since then they have been living there. We the local population has no strength to ask them not to stay in Dumbo. They have been harassing people in the area” he says.
“Their stay there has attracted Ambazonia boys who want to restore Monday traditional ghost town” he explains further.
At the moment, inhabitants of Dumbo village situated between Nkambe and Ako are being targeted by separatist fighters. Some inhabitants say if the military is not present in the village, violent activities from the separatists will stop.

0,Kondengui inmates distance selves from Living Together initiative  ,"August 17, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Over 50 Anglophone detainees at the Yaounde Central Prison, Kondengui, have distanced themselves from a Living Together initiative purportedly plotted by Mancho Bibixy

In a letter dated Saturday September 23, 2018, signed and secretly released to the public, they indicated that none of them was consulted before another letter addressed to the Minister of Territorial Administration (MINAT), Paul Atanga Nji, was written.
“We the undersigned Ambazonian prisoners of conscience illegally abducted and jailed in the Yaounde Central Prison in Kondengui following the dubbed “Anglophone Crisis” since 2016, distance ourselves from a document in circulation titled “A Mini Football Tournament for Peace and Unity,” from the Yaounde Central Prison. We were never consulted nor did we mandate anybody to organise a “Living together” (Vivre ensemble) tournament pitting Anglophones Vs Francophones,” the letter read in part.
The inmates went furthered that such letter signed by Mancho Bibixy, and Ngalim Elvis, is null and void, giving that a majority of Anglophone detainees don’t adhere to any living together initiative.
It should be recalled that a leaked letter circulating on social media and supposedly came from Mancho Bibixy and other Anglophone inmates in the Kondengui Maximum security prison, and addressed to the MINAT boss, Paul Atanga Nji, insinuated that Anglophone detainees initiated a mini-football tournament between Anglophones and Francophones. The letter continued that the motive of the initiative is to consolidate Cameroon’s One and indivisibility.
Though both letters carry the names and signatures of recognised Anglophone detainees, Mimi Mefo Info, however continue to indicate that it cannot independently authenticate their veracity.

0,How the Anglophone struggle became an armed conflict,"September 22, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Human Right organisations in Cameroon like The Network for the Defence of Human Right and the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa have estimated that thousands of lives have perished since the start of onslaughts between security forces and pro-independence fighters in the conflict-hit North West and South West regions of Cameroon.
The casualties include civilians, pro-independence fighters and elements of the Cameroon defence forces.
In a recent outing, Barrister Agbor Balla, President of the outlawed Consortium of Anglophone Civil Society actors said over five hundred thousand English-speaking Cameroonians have been displaced in Cameroon and in Nigeria. He added that over 126 houses have been burned or destroyed.
The question is how did the situation come this far?
A cross section of protesters
It all began in September 22nd after the Anglophone population; young and old carried peace plants and stormed the streets to condemn marginalisation, the arrest of their leaders and brothers, and called for independence.
Today September 22 marks a year after Southern Cameroonians in the North West and South West came out en masse on September 22, 2017, demonstrating and brandishing peace plants, declaring they want freedom.
The protest was on at home while the head of state President Paul Biya was addressing the 72nd UN General Assembly, in New York. The president who spoke on terrorism around the world and the need for peace at home did not for once mention the long-running crisis which has grounded courts, schools and economic activities in the North West and South West regions since November 2016.
As the minority Anglophone population protested to create a state called Ambazonia, they were crushed by elements of Cameroon Defence Forces who used live bullets on unarmed civilians.
Security Forces on the street
RHEDAC revealed after the September 22nd protest that hundreds of civilians were killed, thousands arrested and dozens missing and called on the government of Cameroon to investigate and serve justice.
The government is still to give an account of what rights defenders described as a massacre.
After the huge protest, reports of armed groups created in Manyu, Lebialem, Ndian…Momo Divisions started emerging. As at now, dozens have been created all over Southern Cameroon and the rate of cross fire has continued to multiply.
We at Mimi Mefo info are of the opinion that dialogue or negotiations with engaged in the presence of a mediator for peace to return.

0,Pandemonium At Meme High Court As Stray Bullet Hits Lady,"September 21, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"It was an atmosphere of panic, confusion and pandemonium following wounds sustained on the head by a lady at the Meme High Court in Kumba. Sources who were at the court premises when the incident occurred told Mimi Mefo info that the entire High Court area was in total confusion when a stray bullet from an undisclosed area hit the lady on the head and left her bleeding.
The lady whose only name we got as Prudencia, is said to have arrived the Meme High Court from the Kosala neighbourhood to fulfill requirements for the establishment of her national identity card. A source who witnessed the scene revealed that, Prudencia was hit by stray bullet at the gate of the court though no one could exactly confirm direction from where it came from.
Onlookers are said to her discovered her bleeding after sounds of gunshots were heard. We learnt that Prudencia was rushed to the Kumba District Hospital for immediate medical attention.
The exact direction from where the bullet came from is still a mystery but conflicting reports hold that the bullet might have come from the direction of Dubai center, a popular business hub where phone repairs are done directly opposite the Kumba main market. It is said that two sounds of gun shots were heard around the Dubai center area from the military. Reports still to be confirm have it that, the military storm the area in search of suspected Ambazonia fighters.
Other sources around the market area confirmed to us that one person was shot dead and later carried away. We cannot independently confirm if the corpse was carried away by the security forces or council officials. The said incident comes barely 24 hours after another suspected Ambazonia fighter was shot dead around the Kumba Town neighbourhood in Kumba.
It is said two suspected Ambazonia fighters stormed a popular spot around the area and were reportedly demanding for support. The inhabitants are said to have refused donating any money if their commander did not come himself. If was in the course of the exchange that one person is said to have alerted the forces of law and order who stormed the area and shot one of them dead, leaving the other two fleeing for safety.

0,The Tombel-Bouba 3 Drama You Never Knew!,"September 15, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"News of the arrest of some four alleged Ambazonian kidnappers in Bouba 3, Tombel sub division, broke out like wildlife earlier this week. The story went that a group of men posing as Ambazonian fighters, besieged the Bouba 3 locality, harassing people and collecting property. The high-point came when a young man, said to be the son of a notable in the village, was kidnapped and taken to an unknown destination.
According to the information, the population, alerted the military, giving them hints on where the supposed kidnappers were.
On Tuesday September 11, 2018, the military, in collaboration with the population, mounted a swift operation that ended with a siege around the premises of the said kidnappers.
According to the news, four individuals were arrested, while a number of others succeeded to escape. Besides rescuing the boy, some weapons, electronic gadgets, and people’s property were also retained. The population in anger, burnt down the house where the assailants were perpetrating their activities.
However, fleeing victims who witnessed the incident have been narrating a completely different story.
What Really Happened?
According to more than one witnesses who lived the ordeal, the kidnapped story seems to have masked the crux of the matter plaguing Bouba 3.
They indicated that Bouba 3, a locality cutting across Tombel, in the Southwest Region, and Njombe Penja, Moungo Division of Littoral Region, has over five years been plagued with chieftaincy issue. Both Bouba 3, claimed heirhood to the chiefdom governing them. The dire situation has been going on for over fiver years.
Reports say, the situation had gone so bad that both sides of the divide decided to use different tactics to fulfil their ego. Such tactics had led to the demise of many villagers on both sides.
Tuesday’s incident, according to our source, could just have been one of such ploys staged by the Francophone Bouba 3 faction so as to get rid of their Anglophone Bouba 3 brothers.
According to one of our sources, whose house was razed by the population from mainly the Francophone Bouba 3 side, they were going about their normal activities that fateful Tuesday when all of a sudden, the military besiege the area and began firing shots in the air, and arresting people.
The source told Mimi Mefo info they ran for their lives into the forest, only to return late in the night to find their houses and properties burnt down. That was what, according to him, caused the most if not, all of them to flee their village to safer zones.
Our sources equally indicated that the kidnapped story was cooked up so as to suit the agenda of those who perpetrated the Machiavelli act.
The information was corroborated by another source who said when he first ran to the Francophone Bouba 3 side, he was chased away, brandishing him as one of those Ambazonian kidnappers, a thing he had no idea about.
It should be noted that, while many houses have been razed to ashes in the Anglophone Bouba 3, none was touched in the Francophone side. This further gives more meaning to the narrative that the whole issue was staged by the Francophone Bouba 3 so as to get rid of those of the Anglophone side.

0,"CDC, Pamol Plantations Bleed As Anglophone Crisis Worsens","October 13, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"One of the devastating consequences of the crisis hitting the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon is a paralyzed economy.
More than 60,000 direct employees have been rendered jobless following the closure of most and major agro-poles which served as backbone of the economy in these regions.
One of such paralyzed industries is PAMOL Plantations, considered as the heartbeat of Ndian Division.
It is a large agro-industrial company which grows oil palms and rubber as its main crops.
It is being described as the heartbeat of Ndian Division with more 90% of the economy of Ndian relying on Pamol since about 95% of Pamol is located in Ndian Division.
Though Pamol is largely built in the Ndian Division, it has a branch office in Douala and the Head Office in Lobe Estate, Ekondo-Titi.
Pamol has palm mills in Lobe Estate -Ekondo Titi and Ndian mill in Mundemba subdivisions. Its key products are: Palm oil, Palm Kernel, Palm Kernel oil, Soap, Sludge Oil, Seedlings and Palm Kernel Cake.
It has palm plantations in
Ndian, Lobe and Bai in Meme Division, where they specialize in the production of palm oil.
Pamol also specializes in the production of rubber which covers a total land surface area of about 10,300 hectares and a capital of approximately 1.874 billion pumped in by the government of Cameroon highest share and para-public and private companies.
Of recent, a new plantation has been opened in Ekondo Nene, still in Ndian Division and there is an ongoing project in Bakassi Peninsula at Musongisele sponsored by the state to disenclave Bakassi.
Supervised by the ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development and Finance, the plantation is governed by a board of directors, 12 in number which represent the various partners, headed by a board chairman Bernard Okalia Bilai, who doubles as Governor of the South West Region of Cameroon.
Pamol is managed by a General Manager, Chief MEKANYA CHARLES OKON and assisted by a deputy CHIEF ALOYSIUS ASANGA. They manage five departments: plantations and research, administration and finance, technical, internal audit and human resources.
Pamol employs approximately 3,500 people directly who have gone for months without pay according to revelations from the president of workers syndicate in 2016.
Before the Anglophone crisis, the company had a giant plan of FCFA 14 billion to renovate her old equipments, dilapidated houses, farms and a general modernisation; with the ongoing projects on the extension to Bakassi for dis-enclavement and the development of Bakassi mainly engineered and sponsored by the Government.
But unfortunately, since the start of the anglophone crisis, the company is in ruins as workers were threatened by alleged pro independence fighters.
The company is unable to pay her debts, and workers for months haven’t received a dime.
“A good number of us no longer live there…we left because we were not sure when the crisis will end…staying for months without salaries and maximum security was also discouraging..” a Worker at Pamol recounted to Mimi Mefo info.
The company is facing a very serious problem as there no maintenance being done on its installations. ” How can technicians engage maintenance work when they can be targeted?” The source questioned.
The first mill of what is today PAMOL Plantations Plc, was inaugurated on the 14th of April 1967 by Cameroon’s first President Amadou Ahidjo in Lobe.
At that time, the company was known as “Plantations Pamol Du Cameroun” and owned by a British company by name, Unilever.
When the expatriates left in the late 1980s, because the prices of rubber and palm oil plummeted across the board making their operations unprofitable, Plantations Pamol du Cameroun, was placed under liquidation.  At this point, Unilever got pollination insects from the research centre in Lobe conducted by a team led by Dr. Syed and exported to Unilever plantations in Malaysia and that boosted their production about 3-folds causing them to find no reason to stay in Cameroon.
However, the company continued operations until July 1996, when Pamol Plantations Ltd was created through a debt equity swap between creditors of the defunct Plantations Pamol du Cameroun Ltd, which was still a subsidiary of Unilever and shareholders of the new company.
The new company kick started its operations in November, 1996. Pamol Plantations Ltd was transformed into Pamol Plantations Public Liability Company in November, 2006 to conform to the OHADA treaty and it has remained as such to date.
The Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) is also in crisis.
With over 20,000 contracts of employment, the company has been unable to meet up with her obligations.
Workers have since not been paid and there’s no sign things will get better given that all the plantations, mills and factories are down.
According to Ambazonian leaders and fighters, these companies are contributing enormously to the growth of the economy of Cameroon but government has failed to provide basic social facilities to the people like good road network, portable water….

They also complain, the companies are being managed and run by their French speaking counterparts whereas very few companies in the francophone regions are controlled by anglophones.

0,Medical Facilities Shut Down In Menchum Valley As Violence Soars,"October 5, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Spate of violence in Menchum Valley, a subdivision in Menchum, Northwest Region, has paralysed activities in hospitals and medical centres. Incessant attacks between the Cameroon’s Defence Forces and the Ambazonian fighters, have caused medical personell to vacate the area and run to safer sites.
According to an authoritative source who works with one of the government health centres in Benakuma, headquarters of Menchum Valley, indiscriminate shootings adorned with threats from the military not to treat civilians, caused the medics to run for their lives.
“All medical personnel have run for safety in fear of reprisal attacks. We have continuously been receiving threats from the military not to treat any civilian with blood, in suspect that the civilian would be an Amba fighter. The shootings there on daily basis is too much. We could not bare it for long,” narrated, our source, who pleaded for anonymity.
The source expantiated by saying that these medical facilities used to take care of over 60,000 people who live in the16 villages that make up the valley. The absence of the hospital, he added, will mean the explosion of some of those epidermal diseases, which used to be contained at the health centres.
“Health centres like that of Beba, Mukuru, Befang, Benade, Modelle, Baworo, Benabinge and the district hospital in Benakuma-Esimbi, are all closed since mid-July. In fact, we used to have over 10 blood transfusions in a month for mostly kids, and over 12 deliveries. We also operated other complicated activities like caesarean session, hyena, etc. I wonder what has become of that over 60000 inhabitants of that sub division”the source narrated.
The situation becomes even more compounding with the absence of administrative authorities who have all fled the incessant violence that characterise the subdivision.
It should be noted that, ever since the Divisional Officer of Menchum Valley, Lokombe Derek Mwanjo, was arrested and later released, all, if not, most of the supervisory authorities (including him), long fled the sub division, living their sub ordinates to the mercy of the unending violence.
Reports say the roads leading to the sub division remain largely blocked, making accessibility impossible.
“Menchum Valley Sub-divisional headquarters, Benakuma, has been in darkness and no telephony network, since July 3, 2017. All roads blocked by Amba fighters. All the administrators and even the security forces have run away. We felt left all alone, so we had no choice but to also flee for our sear lives,” the source elucidated.
Menchum Valley is bordered in the West by Cross-River State Nigeria, South by Akwaya and Balin, in the North by Wum Central and Esu, and in the east by Bafut
The situation in Menchum Valley is not isolated.
Investigations over the past eight months have shown that medical personnel are being targeted by largely government forces, who insist that patients with bullet wounds should not be treated.
A certain medic in Menji, Lebialem, was killed earlier this year while on duty. Same fate has been medics in Munyenge, Kwa-kwa, like other places.
Such punitive sanctions have caused many of these medics to fled their area of operation, hence, leaving the vulnerable villagers to perish in their illness.
According to a UN resolution on protecting hospitals, medical professionals and patients from “an epidemic of attacks” on health facilities in war zones, all parties to armed conflicts must fully comply with their obligations under international law … to ensure the respect and protection of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities”.

The resolution, which was drafted by New Zealand, Spain, Egypt, Japan and Uruguay and adopted in 2015, came days after 55 people died when a hospital was bombed in the Syrian city of Aleppo.

0,UN genocide expert demands investigations into killings of Anglophones in Cameroon,"October 5, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"A special UN adviser against genocide Adama Dieng demands an urgent investigation into the killings in the north west and south West regions of Cameroon.
Dieng said the continues and deepening killings in these regions are disturbing and the Government and Ambazonians must negotiate to stop the blood bath.
The U.N diplomat affirmed that that crimes committed by the government and separatist on the people of the two English speaking regions will be invested and perpetrators duly punished, because non of them is above the law.
Dieng, UN expert on genocide affirmed that over 400 people have been killed and still being killed in the north west and south west regions. He said the kind of crimes committed in these regions are hard to explain, thereby warranting tougher and special measures to end the crisis.
Apart from the arbitrary killings in the north west and south west, genocidal or summary Killings videos have emerged from other conflict hit areas of Cameroon, notably the far north region, implicating the Cameroonian military. The government of Cameroon, however proceeded to the arrest of soldiers suspected of the killings.

0,Hon. Njong Says ELECAM Has Exposed The CPDM In North West,"October 4, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"“The Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement, CPDM has always prided itself in deceiving the world on the situation in the North West Region. They misinform the world on what is happening, claiming all is well, whereas they cannot even go to their respective constituencies….They must go and vote there,” these are the words of Hon. Njong Evaristus, a Social Democratic Front (SDF) party, Member of Parliament (MP) for Boyo.
He was speaking, Thursday October 4, 2018, in an exclusive interview granted Mimi Mefo Info.
According to the MP, the Northwest Region is on its knees, with no activity moving.
To him, the spade of violence between Cameroon’s Defence forces and the Ambazonia fighters, has caused untold damages to the socio-political and economic life of the region.
“Dead bodies are littered everywhere in the streets, everywhere is closed. Nothing is moving.
Yet, the CPDM party tells the world all is going on well, and elections should hold in a region that has been emptied of majority of its electorates,” Hon. Njong added.
The SDF Scribe posited that the CPDM’s move to petition the Elections Management Body (ELECAM), to transfer some of its members from other divisions to vote in Bamenda, is a true test of the malicious deceptions that the same party has been telling the world.
“Didn’t the CPDM say all is well in this region? Why then can the Prime Minister and his cohorts not able to vote in their respective constituencies? All their divisions have been blocked and invaded by ceaseless fighting. They are now scared of their own lives and so want ELECAM to give them free meal to eat in Bamenda. Even if that were to happen, what then becomes of the other electorates trapped in those regions whose names are not in this elites oriented list? By the way, they can never vote in Bamenda,” Hon Njong added.
Meanwhile, the MP calls on ELECAM to stick to the law and never revoke their decision to deny the CPDM request. He also calls on the world to be on the guard, so that the CPDM party doesn’t use Machiavellian tactics to buy their way out.
“We all know the CPDM party is great at breaking the laws of the land. They can always use malicious means to find their out. However, we are calling on ELECAM, to do the right thing. No CPDM militant will be permitted to vote out of their constituencies. We also call on the world to observe and denounce any malicious move,” Hon Njong alarmed.
It should be recalled that, the CPDM party petitioned ELECAM on Saturday September 29, 2018, pleading for the voting centres of some of its members be relocated to either Bamenda I, II or III.
They posed insecurity and mass exodus on some of its members, as the main concerns for their request.
Unfortunately, members of the Mezam Divisional Supervisory board of ELECAM, rejected the petition, indicating that such moves will go against the law.
ELECAM has in a document issued on October 1 said only 77 polling centres have been created out of the 2343 existing polling stations in the entire North West region.

In PM’s Bui for instance counting 401 polling stations, only 12 polling zones(centres) have been created.

To the SDF, these reduction is not only alarming, it is clear indication that millions will not be able to exercise their civic rights as it will be difficult for them to leave the suburb, cover kilometres to take part in the election.

The SDF wants all the polling stations to be maintained so that all eligible voters will be able to take part in the election.

0,Gunmen burn Benjamin Itoe’s Bombe Bakundu Residence,"September 30, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Unknown gunmen believed to be elements of the pro-independence Ambazonia fighters have burnt down the Bombe Bakundu residence of the Permanent Divisional Coordinator of the CPDM party in Meme Division.
Benjamin Mutanga Itoe’s residence situated just behind the grandstand at Bombe Bakundu, Mbonge Sub-Division in Meme Division went up in flames in the evening of Saturday September 29, 2018.
The incident comes barely two days after the former Minister alongside other CPDM diehard militants defied threats from Ambazonia fighters to successfully launch campaigns for the re-election of their party candidate, incumbent President Paul Biya in Kumba.
We gathered that the gunmen stormed his residence and vandalised the doors in order to get access into the building before setting it ablaze.
Sources close to Mutanga told Mimi Mefo Info that he has been lamenting and condemning the said act adding that it is the second time his home is set ablaze because of CPDM political issues after that of 1992 that was done by the SDF.
We gathered the said storey building is one of the highest investment of the former Minster who now doubles as a member of the Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism.
To recall is the fact that Mutanga, who, is also Board Chairman of the CDC had long escaped the escalating violence caused by the ongoing Anglophone crisis in the Division.
He only resurfaced under heavy military convoy to launch CPDM campaigns and immediately vamoosed to Fako after the launching.
At the launching over the weekend, Mutanga urged militants of the CPDM to lure Ambazonia fighters to leave the bushes and embark on a dialogue with Meme CPDM elite.

0,Dead Sunday In Anglophone Regions As Gov’t Imposes “Ghost Towns”,"September 30, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Sunday September 30, 2018 will go down memory-lane in the two English Speaking Regions of Cameroon. Denizens woke up to a dead city this Sunday, as no one dared step foot out of their houses, for fear of the unknown.

This is coming on the heels of an imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew enforced by the administrative authorities of the Northwest and Southwest regions. According to the communique circulated on Social Media, denizens all of the two regions, were warned to remain indoors all day and night, on Sunday September 30, to Tuesday October 2.
The communiques further indicated that the raison d’être for the imposed curfew, is to prevent offensive attacks from the Ambazonian separatist fighters.

From buea, through Limbe, Kumba, Mamfe, Bamenda, Ndop, Mbengwi, to name but this, echoes of dead town resonated across the quarters, streets and towns.
No one dared step foot outside even to check on their neighbours.
Sunday, a characteristic worship day for the predominantly Christian regions, was very dead. No church services, held.

From the look of things, this Monday October 1, 2018, will experience the same fate.
That however, may be perturbed with fighting if the Ambazonian soldiers decide to enforce the celebrations of the supposed Independence Day of Southern Cameroons.
Nonetheless, the govern has taken all security dispositions to ensure that no celebrations of the takes place.
Security forces have been deployed to the nooks and crannies, ready to shoot at anyone who steps out.

It should be noted that, more than half of the population of rhe two English speaking regions, have fled to the Francophone regions, for safety.
Many, as late as Saturday September 29, 2018 night, were seen at various bus tops, boarding vehicles to flee away from the uncertainties that looms on October 1, 2018.

0,Government Scales Up Security At Bamenda Central Prison!,"September 30, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Security has been beefed up at the Bamenda Central Prison after a failed attack by armed men believed to be Ambazonia Separatist Fighters.
Gun men on the night of Saturday, September 29 made attempts to free all inmates at the Bamenda Central Prison.
No one was wounded but an uneasy calm is said to have returned to the detention facility.
An emergency security meeting is ongoing this morning. All warders are called to take guard daily; all warders must be on guard every night including senior staff and prison administrators. Its alleged the gun men came to experience the prison environment and to test the security nature of the main prison in the region. It should be recalled that 80% of prisoners in North West have been transferred to the Bamenda Central Prison because of continuous attacks and the freeing of prisoners in other prisons. The Bamenda Central Prison is located at Up Station, host to the military base and administrative headquarters of the region. Sources say the armed men dropped a note that the real moment is coming and those on guard should prepare for a deadly battle.
The number of inmates At the Bamenda prison has continued to swell in recent years.
The escalation of the Anglophone crisis further compounded the problem.
As at 2011, the Bamenda central prison was hosting 700 inmates which is thrice the normal capacity. But human right organisations have revealed that the number of inmates increased between 2016 and 2018 especially after the transferred from detention centres and cells which came under attack in some conflict hit towns and villages in the region.

0,"As October 1 Narrows: Fears, Uncertainties, Bloody gunfights Engulf North West, South West","September 29, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"There’s no gain saying that well over half of the population in the two English speaking regions of Cameroon has been displaced, due to the ongoing crisis.
The imminence of October 1, whose gory reminiscence of 2017, is yet to be forgotten, resonate an atmosphere of ocitancy in the Northwest and Southwest regions.
Many wonder how October 1, 2018 will like in the restive Anglophone regions, given that Cameroon military that hitherto had monopoly of war arms, now battle fiercely with Ambazonian fighters, a “war” which has lasted for closed to two years now.

The conflict that has migrated from the bushes to towns and city confrontations, only goes a long way to exacerbate the already deploring situation.
No doubt, as the two forces keep on battling for supremacy, it is the common and unarmed civilian, who bare the brunt.
It is now normalcy in parts of the two regions, to go to bed with heavy gunshots every night, and wake up every morning with decapitated bodies.
The situation becomes further compounding when the security forces embark on indiscriminate shooting and killing of civilians,arrests,burning of houses, Ambazonian fighters abducting civilians for ransoms, incessant destruction of administrative structures, and what have you?
Such activities have only left the population with the option of fleeing to safer zones.
The situation remains unclear, if the armed Amba fighters will engage the military in offensive battles on October in Buea and its surrounding like was the case in 2017.
One thing stands tall, the military seems to be combat ready now, more than ever. New military camps have been opened in Wotutu, Tole, Mile 16, Muea, Bonakanda, and other strategic places.
For sure, the military has put all security dispositions to contain any excesses of the Ambazonian defence forces.
While the pro independence fighters have continued to mobilise in groups, blocking roads to paralyse movements into and out of the region before October 1 – independence day of Southern Cameroons and October – Presidential election in Cameroon.
The rumour of the visit of CPDM Presidential Candidate, and incumbent President, Paul Biya, to Buea in the coming days, seems to have added more security fuels in the town of legendary hospitality.

Candidate Paul Biya, is rumoured to visit Buea, so as to campaign for the Presidential Elections billed for October 7.
It is rumoured that he shall also address the ongoing crisis plaguing the Northwest and Southwest Regions.

0,Arsonists Torch Kumbo City Community Radio,"October 31, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"The City Community Radio in Kumbo has not aired for several hours after the media house was visited by arsonists last night.
Management and workers of the radio only got up this morning and discovered the rate of damage as a result of what they described as an “arson attack”.
The entire content of the radio house was emptied and set on fire in front of its host storey building.

“Everything was destroyed…the city community radio has not been on air…,” a Kumbo local told Mimi Mefo info.
Sources say Ambazonian fighters masterminded the attack after a failed attempt on October 2 to kidnap the Station Manager, Ntagwa Johdzeven Laurence, whom they qualify as a “traitor”.
He was being accused of collaborating with the Military, as an informant.
This is not the first attack on community radio stations in the North West Region since the anglophone crisis escalated.
Sky FM in Ndu also came under similar attack early August 2018.
Reacting to the incident, the Committee to Protect Journalists strongly condemned attacks on journalists and media houses.
“All parties to the conflict in Cameroon, whether government forces or Ambazonians, should stop targeting journalists and media organizations and allow them to operate safely and without fear of reprisal…The media is not the enemy. Journalists are simply trying to do their jobs by ensuring that citizens are armed with useful information in what has become an increasingly bloody phase in Cameroon’s history,” said Angela Quintal, CPJ Africa Program Coordinator.
The City Community Radio in Mbveh Market has been off air since last night after its transmitters were damaged due the Tuesday night inferno.

The Defence Minister also cautioned foreigners getting into the conflict zones to notify security officials so they can be provided maximum security. He failed to give security assurances to civilians living in the conflict hit zones.
While addressing a message of condolence to the bereaved family, the Defense Minister also congratulated soldiers for their professionalism in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
In another outing Tuesday, October 30,the Ambazonian leaders fighting for the independence of Southern Cameroons blamed soldiers of the National Defence force for the killing.
Dave Halyaman, assistant pastor at Believers Baptist Church in Warsaw, Ind, said Wesco, his wife and one of their sons were traveling with another missionary to go shopping on Tuesday morning when at least two shots were fired, striking the windshield and hitting Wesco twice.
The victim, was taken to a nearby clinic for treatment, then transferred to the Regional hospital in Bamenda where “doctors attempted to resuscitate him but were unsuccessful.”
44 year old Charles Wesco, who was living and working as a missionary in Bamenda, Cameroon, is brother of Timothy Wesco, who serves in Indiana’s House of Representatives.

0,Anglophone Crisis: Untold Misery In Donga Mantung Division,"October 31, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By Dominic Meme Nwakimo.
An untold misery has befallen the population of Donga Mantung Division in the North West region of Cameroon.
Movement of people and vehicles from the division to Bamenda, headquarters of the North West region has been on a halt since September 25, 2018 when the road was cut off by militia men fighting for the restoration of the Ambazonia Republic.
That alone has totally paralyzed several socio political and economic activities in the divison that shares boundary with Taraba State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
First, the disconnection by road has grounded all administrative duties. Civil servants have gone for a month now without receiving their salaries.
This is because of the absence of standard banks in the divisional headquarters, Nkambe and with no access to Bamenda, they are forced to stay without money.
Given that most basic necessities are purchased in Bamenda, the blockage caused by the crisis has been manifesting its side effects through increase of prices of all items. For instance, a liter of kerosene that formally cost 400FCFA is today sold for 900FCFA, a cube of maggi cost 50FCFA. Sugar, vegetable oil, groceries and other related items used daily have all seen their prices increased.
Beside this, most provision shops have mainly closed down. Owners argue that the business climate does not yield profit but instead drain their capital.
At the level of telecommunication, the close to one month absence of electricity in Donga Mantung Division has automatically put an end to most mobile phone networks.
Residents say what is left in this domain is the epileptic telephone connection of Nexttel company through which they seldom make calls to connect to the rest of the world.

0,Genocide In Bali? -Bali Nyonga In Its Worst Period In History,"October 27, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"It is often said that the soils of Bali Nyonga are most slippery in the dry season than the rainy season.
For over one and a half years, since the anglophone crises started, Bali Nyonga, in Mezam Division, was relatively calm and peaceful.
The people of Bali Nyonga, were often accused of being traitors of the anglophone cause, “for unanimously not supporting the struggle”.
Ever since the wind blew across the town, Bali has been transformed into “anything else but the anglophone struggle; scores-settling, vendetta within and between families, between members of opposing parties and so on.”
“For the past five months, a day will hardly go by without news, that a Bali resident has been slaughtered directly by one of his brothers in a gang or in connection to a gang,” a local in grief explained to Mimi Mefo Info.
Ba Tahnah aka Mangwana, Retired Gendarme Musi, Ba Tavat a lecturer in the University of Bamenda, Manyang, Mr Fosang alias Chop For Your Way, Ba Takapa (who died after he was brutalised)…and the list continues, have been sent to meet their ancestors by the suspected Bali Nyonga Restoration Force.

“Last Thursday a primary school mate to me came for some dresses. He told me that if one just dresses shabily even as result of poverty, the military guns you down. So i gave him some dresses to look abit in order to move around.
He explained to me that there is total anarchy in the village. No authority, no teacher, no student, 60% of the population have left the village.
On the killings:
He said, the boys went and took the soyer seller, Mangwana alias, Nkemkem right at the market buchery on a market day. When they came 2 on a bike the told him <> The other people around told him not to resist. He was whisked off, and 30minutes after, they boys called their compound and asked the relatives to come and take his corpse at G.S Bali. They went to a shop keeper at Jamjam and he begged them, offered money, plot, his total bank accounts… But they boys refused and said they are after his life. In front of the people who came to buy, they shot him dead….
They went to Ba Nyamdi’s elder brother at Gungong, cut his 3 toes and cut the leg of 4 other people. Simply on a rumour that there was a ballot box in their keeping…Went to the Bamenda Branch Manager of Bali credit Union, asked him to bring his wife…He said she left the house already…they entered, searched and found her hidden. They pulled her out and shot her dead. Shot the manager on his leg for lying to them. The woman’s crime was because gendarmes ate at her place and that she voted.
Also, the CMF President and shot. That he is black leg.
Even if people vote against their orders, is death what the violators should be punished with? The uprising started eslwhere but we have not heard brothers killing brothers. The enmity that has been sowned in Bali will take generations to be cleared.
My good old friend said when the woman was shot, an oldman in their compound exclaimed in the dialect and said <>, that their forefathers never shot women even at the war front because it brings curse.”
A renown scholar from Bali, troubled about the situation recounted.
“My daughter, i am ashamed tobe a Bali man now. We used to be proud people. But am ashamed. Even in the years of conquest, Bali people don’t shot a woman at the war front. Where have those boys kept their dignity. Shooting a woman during war!!!!!!!!!. It’s unheard of in Bali history.
The Military is committing their own atrocities like every where in anglophone Cameroon….the miliary shot Ba Tita Langha and the teacher from cpc bali..and several other cases…But the brutality on the people by their own brothers is too much and unheard of.” He added.
They were killed for allegedly supporting or obstructing the struggle, were considered spies or were framed by unknown persons.
When you meet Rwandans, they will refuse to hear about what happened in 1994, because they came a time where one could eat his/her brother or sister; the gun was imaginarily too distant from the target to the point where the executor wanted to be closer to the flesh.
That is how “genocide” gained grounds in Rwanda.
Sociological theories suggest that every human being is more attached to his family, his village before his country.
“What shall it benefit us if and when we get a new nation in the name of Ambazonia or a United Republic and we have lost Bali Nyonga, the very foundation of our existence? How shall we reconcile these ignominous crimes and genocide between families in Bali? How shall we bring our families scattered over the whole country and Nigeria, some are taking new businesses where they are, some are likely to get married, some of the elderly ones are dieing in their displaced locations.
Heads of extended families are displaced from their family members, Husbands are displaced from their wives. How do we put all these together after the anglophone crises, a crises of political and national character beyond our village competence is resolved?” a Bali Nyonga resident put these unanswered questions to Mimi Mefo Info.
This same wind of change crossed over in Manyu, in Kwakwa, in Lebialem, in Batibo, it did not take the magnitude of internal genocide it is taking in Bali, where the people are unsafe before their own, than the forces, considered as intruders in several parts of English Speaking Cameroon.
“Today, it just suffices to be a neatly dressed person, a successful business man, politician, holder of traditional title and professional titles and your brother or sister who has been jealous of your success for so many years will point you to the amba boys that you are not supporting the struggle, then your life is at stake.
Write ups are just everywhere bearing names of persons from sources only God knows. To avoid danger, victims are busy writing disclaiming messages.
Nobody in opposing or supporting camp is spared. Was this what it was supposed to be? It is possible to proof ignominous actions but not as easy to proof people you suspect as spies or not in support. CRY OUR BELOVED BALI, the land and culture we have so yearned to maintain.” Our source continued to lament.
Mimi Mefo Info was curious to find out how the disturbing situation could be addressed. Our source who opted for anonymity wasted no time in enumerating them.
He rolled out the following recommendations:
“It is not the case here to justify whether the secessionist movement is genuine or not, whether it should stop or not because it is not our competence. It is about crying the existence of a village wherein things have taken the worst genocidal magnitude.”
“It is about telling the boys who all are our family members that the Anglophone crisis is bigger than Bali or our existence, as <> in Bali is paramount, they are part of us and we all know how to reach them.
Some of you are sponsors, sympathiser and they can listen to you.” He said.
“1.At the beginning of the struggle, many understood that to instill and maintain Ghost town you had the responsibility of sending atleast 30 messages to all of your family members and friends. You can do same to stop this genocide in Bali. Let the sensitising message get to every household, again, they are all yours.”
“2. There is also need to get all from all opposite camps who radicalised because they lost their loved ones, were hurt or were detained, that no matter where we go, the ideal is to forgive.
This maybe painful to forgive, but no matter where things end, it will end with the ability to forgive and this ability will determine our existence.
No worst has been the case of Rwanda and if reconciliation could happen in Rwanda why not Cameroon?
“Reconciliation was the pathway in South Africa, let that be the watchword here.”
“3.The misunderstanding leading to this genocidal situation in Bali has come to question the very raison d’etre of the existence of the Bali Development and Cultural Associations and others in the diaspora and at home; the BCAs (USA, Europe, France, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, China, Thailand, Finland, Norway, Switzerland etc). We need to question whether we can carry out any development in this condition.
Whether we should fold our hands, because it is not cultural or developmental discussion.
It is not about sustaining discussion for or against the struggle in Bali which is where the risk and division is.”
“4. Lastly we need the cooperation of the many political elite, given that our relatives cannot return home in peace, if they are at risk with forces of law and order, let them be at ease with their brothers.
It is arguably said that if there was relative calm, no one killed (though some arrested), it was because of the wit and tact of some elite who made sure they guided the forces of law and order that no blood was spilled in Bali.
There our people can return and live in relative calm.We need all the competences, all hands put together to stop this shameful situation.
No blame games will take us anywhere. For everyone knows the pathway is forgiveness and flexibility.”
“Above all, we need God and the fear of God.”

0,Fru Ndi Breaks The Silence!,"October 27, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Ni John Fru Ndi has accused some government ministers for invading and transforming into arm robbery, the Anglophone struggle which he has described as a genuine cause.
According to the SDF Chair, different groups of bandits have been created to terrorise and extort money from population.
“The population have suffered a lot since this struggle began and they are still suffering…you cannot be fighting to liberate a people, yet, they are the victims of human right abuses daily and injustice…” John Fru Ndi told the press as he visited Baba II, after his house was set on fire.

Ni John Fru Ndi condemned what he called intimidation and threats from purported Amba boys.
“They fired in the air thinking it will scare me. Let me tell you….I will only die, when God says so…” he said.
Ni John Fru Ndi visited Baba II, to see for himself, the rate of damage after his home was visited by arsonists.
He is also worried about the population who complain of constant threats from the armed men.
“Since these boys came to the village two months ago life has been made difficult for us. We cannot go to our farms freely. They have been beating us in the sole of our feet. They got one of our brothers who is a hunter well beaten” an inhabitant told Mimi Mefo Info.
“If you are fighting because you want to restore anglophones then you have to protect them,” Fru Ndi told Amazonian captain known as captain Die Man at his Baba 2 residence when he met with them.
Ni John Fru Ndi added that his home was attacked because he was accused of working with local authorities.
“After my arrival in Bamenda, my driver, Salifu Waziru, was shot in the ankle at the fish pond hill towards the Bamenda food market as he returned home after dropping me…I saw this as an attack on the people because this was recurrent…so I went to see the governor to warn him about the actions of the military….since these boys have their agents all over, they reported to them that I went to the governor for him to send soldiers to fight them. That night they relocated from their hide out. Next day they decided to burn my house. I’m told before burning they looted property,” Fru Ndi revealed.
The over five roomed building and property worth over 120 millions of Ni John Fru Ndi, was reduced to nothing.
“My only Joy is my green house was not touched.” Chairman Fru Ndi declared.
Construction works have begun to erect a new building at the site.
According to the chairman, spending the end of year feast in the village has been a routine and this year will not be an exception.
Speaking to press men upon returning to his Ntarinkon residence, the chairman urged the Ambazonian leaders to put the people’s interest first.
“The leadership of Amazonia should reorientate what they are fighting for because they cannot be fighting to restore Anglophones and the Anglophones are suffering much more from them” he said.
He called on the government whom to him has failed to address the Anglophone problem when it escalated, to take urgent measures before things get out of hand.
Ni John Fru Ndi also told the press that Biya’s victory came as surprise.
“I don’t see Cameroonians that dump, voting for Mr Biya, talk less of the anglophone regions…it is only in Cameroon that a candidate campaigns for 22minutes and wins an election,” he added.
This is the second time the residence of the national chairman is being attacked since the crisis began in the North West and South West regions of the country. First it was an attempt to put fire at his Ntarinkon residence and now his baba residence burnt to ashes.

0,Man in Distress After Gunmen Raze Car In Wotutu,"October 15, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Mr Alain Taboh, a popular architectural engineer based in Wotutu, a village in the Buea Municipality, is now in a desperate condition, after gunmen razed his brand-new car in front of his house.
As the story goes, the gunmen, suspected to be Ambazonian fighters, stormed his compound, Saturday October 13 2018, demanding the head of a military officer who is reported to be a tenant of the building.
“It was around 10pm that Saturday that some 10 hefty looking guys broke into our compound, demanding the head of a military man who rents here. They banged on all the doors, shattering the louvres while requesting the military man to come out. As they tried in vane to get hold of the army, they ran out and burnt down my car,” Mr Taboh said.

The engineer highlighted that though the village in recent times has been marred by heavy fighting between the Amba fighters and the military, he has however, saved a good relationship with all the warring factions.
He bemused while the suspected Amba fighters, whom he said knows him well as well as his car, would transfer their aggression on him.

It should be noted that more than half of the population of Wotutu village, have migrated following wanton fighting between the pro-independence fighters and the military.
The village renowned for the production of cash and fast crops, is now heavily deserted, with the streets and quarters empty.
The Cameroon military recently created a base in the village, to combat offensives from the Amba fighters.

0,Buea Regional Hospital Director Throws Jabs At Government – Prof. Enow Orock says release of all those detained will solve the Anglophone crisis by 40% in one week,"February 14, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"A renowned professor and state official in Cameroon has said ongoing tensions in the North West and South West Regions could be minimised by 40 per cent if the Head of State releases jailed Ambazonian leaders.
“If by 6:00pm, the head of state releases all those arrested including the leaders, in at most one week, things will be solved by an estimated 40 percent. The more you brutalise and arrest the fighters, the more you get youths radicalized,” Professor George Orock Enow declared.
The Director of the Buea Regional Hospital continued that arresting moderates gives room for radicals and that because of government’s poor management of the crisis, the situation is deteriorating.
“Opportunities to solve this crisis have been missed… People have been radicalized. So many people have died; government soldiers, civilians and fighters,” he lamented.
Professor Enow Orock thinks that granting amnesty to all those in jail and sitting on a round table for dialogue, is the only way out of the current impasse.
“Whatever happens, there must be a round table conference. Even in two, five or ten years. And when that time comes, the biggest question will be, was all the bloodshed worth it? Contrary to what Honorable Joseph Wirba said, the Anglophone problem may not sink Cameroon…the Country may learn from this crisis and sit together on a common table for a way out of all the problems plaguing the country…
“Why not sit now on the round table and spare more lives?” Professor Enow George questioned.
The professor did not mince words in condemning what he descibed as government’s role in deepening crisis.
He used an adage to further paint the picture.
Hear him: “You don’t call a dog with a stick in your hand and expect it to come. Even if you are the master or you use several baits.
“The government has it as duty to preserve the unity, integrity of the state and ensure the safety of people and property. The government is nothing without the people. If the people who voted the government have grievances, the government must listen to them. There is no weakness in giving a listening ear. ”
He concluded by underscoring the need for military presence to be reduced.
“When you send soldier in a conflict situation like this, there are two options: either they shoot or are shot. The government should reduce the number of soldiers on the ground. There must also be de-escalation on both sides. The local population is suffering the consequences more.”

0,3 ‘Presidents’ To Address Cameroonians Today!,"December 31, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"By: Nkafou Kingsley
For the first time in Cameroon’s history, three ‘Presidents’ in their own rights would be addressing Cameroonians today, Monday December 31, 2018.
These “Presidents” include the official and legal Head of State of Cameroon, Paul Biya who would be making his traditional end of year address to the nation today at 8:00pm.
Meanwhile, Maurice Kamto who declared himself winner of the October 7 presidential election would also be addressing Cameroonians today.
At the same time, the “President” of the Interim Government of Ambazonia would be addressing Cameroonians mostly from the two restive Anglophone Regions were Restoration Forces want the establishment of the State of Ambazonia.
The three ‘Presidents’ are expected to dwell on the current conflict in the Anglophone Regions, but from different angles. While Paul Biya would be hailing the military despite its poor human rights record in the war and preaching decentralisation as well, Maurice Kamto would be castigating the same military and Yaoundé Government while preaching Federalism. However, with Dr Sako talking from his base in the United States, it would be to shower praises on the fighters on the ground as well as encourage the people to remain steadfast while building the hope of a free Ambazonia in the hearts of the people.
Likewise, the three ‘Presidents’ would be using different channels of mass media to reach out to their targeted population.
While Paul Biya’s message would be broadcast on national radio and television, CRTV, that of Dr Sako would be aired on the separatist run television, the Southern CameroonsBroadcasting Corporation (SCBC) TV and the Ambazonia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV which are based out of the country but available on the internet and satellite.
In the meantime, Maurice Kamto has launched his own television channel named Renaissance 237 TV on December 28 and through it the self-declared President of Cameroon would be passing on his message to his followers.
One major difference would be at the level of language. With Paul Biya’s inability to faithfully utter words in English, his message would be said in French and later on interpreted for the English population.
However, with Kamto’s mastery of both English and French, he would make use of the two languages. But with the pain of Francophone domination and marginalisation Samuel Sako is certainly going to maintain a unilingual approach, making use of the Queen’s language only.
What matters most would be the impact of these messages on the ground. With the world becoming a global village and the inability for the Government to perfectly control communication channels, all three ‘Presidents’ in their own rights would be able to address their people but with varying success as the days after unfold.

0,Top Government Officials Are Running Armed Groups In The NW/SW- Fru Ndi,"December 13, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"In a press conferences in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon, Wednesday 12th of December 2018, the national chairman of the the Social Democratic Front Party-SDF made stunning declarations as he appraised recent happenings in Cameroon.
The Press conference of the SDF National Chairman, focused on the the worsening crisis in the North West and South West Regions, the newly created Fai Yengo Francis-led national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration committee for ex fighters of Boko Harram and armed groups in the north west and south west regions of Cameroon, the withdrawal of the the 2019 AFCON hosting rights from Cameroon by the confederation of African football CAF and the recent banning of Cameroon’s lone air transport company CamairCo from flying to any other destination out of Cameroon.
To the SDF national chairman, Cameroon is sinking and drowning in a deep ocean, regarding
CAF’s decision to withdraw the 2019 AFCON hosting rights from Cameroon and the banning of the country’s lone air transport company from flying out of the country.
Describing the situation in Cameroon as disastrous, Ni John Fru Ndi blamed the misfortune that has befallen Cameroon to what he called, bad governance and poor crisis management in a country where, people are appointed based on political lines, not competence and have to run the country to favor the party instead of the masses.
To In John Fru Ndi, the ruling Cameroon people’s Democratic movement party CPDM, attributes every success or good event in Cameroon to its glory and hence should also assume responsibility for the failures currently being recorded in Cameroon.
On the newly created national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration commission for ex-figthers of Boko Harra and armed groups in the North West and South West Regions led by former governor Fai Yengo Francis, Ni John Fru Ndi said, he is aware, top government officials are running armed groups in the conflict hit regions.
Ni John Fru Ndi said the Committee will worsen than solve the deepening crisis , citing the national commission for the promotion of Bilingualism and multiculturalisms and it’s failed role in resolving the current upheavals in Southern Cameroon.
Ni John Fru Ndi regreted that, no commission created in Cameroon has ever been successful or produced fruitful results.
While congratulating Fai Yengo Francis for his appointment, Fru Ndi stated that Fai Yengo has been given and uphill task, which he will be unable to handle.
He justified the predicted failure of the commission on the point that, much preliminary work ought to have been done before the creation of the commission; like: consultative talks with leaders of the armed groups, calling off the declared war against the people of the north west and south west regions and desintoxication of the armed boys whom he qualified as hardened drug addicts.
“It is wrong to ask Amba Boys to drop their arms while your soldiers go after them shooting burning and destroying property” he said.
He also affirmed to have been reliably informed of top government officials running armed groups which are destroying and looting in the North West and South West Regions.
Ni John Fru Ndi also declared his support for the Cardinal Christian Tumi Anglophone general conference, saying: “we need to start talking with each other, even the Ambazonian leaders as he has always done”.

0,Military Violence Against Civilians is Illegitimate-Dr. Chemuta Divine.,"December 13, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"The chairman of the National Commission on human rights and Freedoms (NCHRF) has condemned the exercise of violence by the military in a bid to stop secessionist tendencies in the two English speaking regions of Cameroon.
Dr Chemuta Divine Banda in his own words says “…human rights institutions in the world recognize legitimate use of violence by the state only when its defending its self from a foreign aggressor . This means in the context of Cameroon, the use of military force against fellow Cameroonians in the two Anglophone regions is illegitimate”
The boss of the commission of human rights and freedoms states, that beside the military and Ambazonia fighters reigning terror in the north west and south west regions, a third group he describe as “opportunists” have taken advantage of the ugly situation to make material and financial gains.
These people he says can not been identify easily.
On the question of the role of Anglophone community in the diasporas in connection to the crisis, Dr Chemuta says some Anglophones in the diasporas are contributing to fuel hostilities back home.
To him, secessionist Anglophones abroad think the struggle has come a long way and there should be no turning back.
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Vs AGC
“The continuous delay of the government of Cameroon to issue a written authorization for the holding of the Anglophone General Conference can finally frustrate the good intentions of the conveners”To Dr Chemuta government is supposed to support the holding of the conference to pave a way for frank and inclusive dialogue.
Speaking on behalf of the national commission for human rights and freedoms in Cameroon, the chairman holds firmly that the committee for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) will be anything to count on if implemented in a spirit of reconciliation.
This, he requests President Paul Biya to call for a seize fire to permit fighters freely lay their arms.
Dr Chemuta Divine Banda regrets the fact that president Paul Biya has continuously ignored concrete recommendations on how to solve the Anglophone crisis that has been dragging on for two years now.

as civil disobedience to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon in
the clamour for the independence of
former Southern Cameroons since
the Anglophone Crisis surged and
has been raging for two years
Municipal and administrative authorities have engaged both fair and
foul means to kill the ghost town phenomenon, but the people are ap-
parently using it as a means of getting back at the Government which
they say has failed to deliver.
The radio message, purporting to
lift the ban on Monday, November
19, has been animating debates
among riders and users of bendskin
services.
In a discussion among
bendskin riders who ply the streets of the Sandpit neighbourhood of
Buea, one said: “I don’t mind work-
ing on Mondays. But the question is;
will there be passengers? I am saying so because potential passengers
stay indoors on Mondays. However,
if there are passengers, I think we
should work because we have been
suffering for the two months that the
ban has lasted.”
Another said: “If we come out on
Monday and do not have passengers,
what should we do?
Another group of bendskin riders
in the Street 7 area were overheard
discussing the ban and the Mayor’s
terms. One lamented that he has
four children, all of them going to
school.
“How does he think I am feeding
my wife and four children? How do I
feed our six mouths? That is my only
source of income. In fact, I have suffered a lot within these two months
of the ban.
“The Ambazonian leaders should
stop punishing us. How do they
think we’re living without working
for the past two months,” one asked?
Another retorted: “It is the Mayor and the DO that banned bendskins in Buea, not the Amba boys. The Mayor and the DO like other Government authorities think it is the bendskins who are fighting against
the Government. But since they
banned bendskin movement, why
has the fight not stopped. They should try to think before taking very harsh decisions.”
Bendskinservices were banned
prior to the October 7 election, when the DO announced, what he termed,the imminent visit of the Head of State to Buea for election campaign. Inhabitants of Buea distant neighbourhoods,who use bendskins
to and from work or business in the
urban centre,say they have been suffering since the ban was slammed on
commercial motorbikes. They pray
that the service should resume.
On Monday, November 19, when
the bendskin riders were expected to
resume services, none of them was
found at their usual stops.
Apparently, they have not yielded to the Mayor’s condition of lifting the ban provided they work on Mondays (ghost town day), or yielded to the warning by Ambazonia leaders requesting a total lockdown of towns and villages in the former Southern Cameroons territory, beginning that
Monday through the entire week, but which was later restricted to that Monday.
Yet, as at the next day, Tuesday, November 20, the bendskins had not working. They and their families are suffering because that is their only
livelihood, and the population that uses their services is suffering.

0,"MMI Editorial: Another seven years for Biya, what for?","November 6, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"One of the world’s most experienced quasi-democrats, Cameroon’s Paul Biya has once again shown the world that he is President not because he wants to, but because he can.
Whether this new seven-year term was got by bending the rules of the game in his direction in ways both old and new or genuine, Biya’s force of experience no doubt played in his favour.
It’s no accident that Paul Biya is the second-longest-ruling head of state in the world who isn’t a monarch. Nor that Cameroon’s Constitutional Council confirmed that Biya, who has been in power for 36 years, has won a seventh term in office and is set to lead the country until 2025 when he will be near 92 years old.
By any objective standard, the Cameroonian election on October 7 was a farce, according to outside observers.
Voter turnout was marked by apathy, and in some regions, outright fear, with credible sources saying that less than one percent of voters cast ballots in some areas.
In the country’s English-speaking regions, harsh crackdowns on an emerging secessionist movement kept many polling stations closed and left others mostly attended by soldiers.
But the country’s Elections body wants the world to know that the elections went just fine, and they can cite “outside monitors” to prove it.
On October 8, state-run outlet Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) interviewed a group of international observers who praised the country’s elections as credible and fair. One election observer, filmed by CRTV and identified as Nurit Greenger, a Transparency International observer, called the elections “extremely good.” She added, “I don’t think there is a way you can cheat.”
There was just one hitch: Transparency International has no election observers in Cameroon, and the organization has no ties to the group that appeared on CRTV.
“It’s still a bit of a mystery as to who decided to say that they were a Transparency International group,” Michael Hornsby, a spokesperson for the organization said. “But I think it’s very telling that one of the individuals kept repeating that they were trained by us—long after we had said we had nothing to do with them.”
The strange spectacle reflects what has become a growing trend of autocrats using new methods to add a gloss of legitimacy to elections that are deeply flawed.
This particular tactic of using outsiders as props has cropped up with such frequency around the world—from Azerbaijan to Equatorial Guinea—that real election experts even have a name for them: “zombie observers.”
“What really stands out in Cameroon and elsewhere is the degree that highly abusive, repressive, and, in this case, dictatorial regimes will go to, to somehow get this stamp of approval,” said Jeffrey Smith, the executive director of Vanguard Africa, a non-profit organization focused on democracy promotion in African states.
Part of that strategy involves doing just enough to keep the United States and other major Western powers from bothering to notice.
In Biya’s corner is a small but powerful constellation of lobbying and public relations firms that the government has embraced in the buildup to the 2018 vote in an effort to buy the prestige of outside approval.
These firms have shouldered the weight of managing the country’s media relationships and keeping in contact with U.S. lawmakers.
“Biya in this case is really trying to play the PR game … they’re trying to somehow present this regime that has been in power for [nearly] 40 years as a credible guarantor of the democratic rights and aspirations of its people,” Elie Smith said. “Once you start peeling back the layers, the opposite is true.”
But the veiled threats from the EU, Paris, London, Washington DC and Ottawa may be for Biya a call to sit up. These foreign concerns have congratulated the Cameroonian people (some congratulated Biya) for their resilience in the face of such long-serving ruler and have called on Biya to engage inclusive dialogue with disgruntled Anglophones.
Kah Walla, who became the first woman to run for president in Cameroon in 2011, calls the country an “electoral dictatorship.
She said: “Keep in mind in electoral dictatorships, the opposition is running against the incumbent, his party, the civil service, the state media, and even most of the private media, which tend to be run by party cadres, as well as the armed forces.”
In Walla’s run against Biya, she experienced the tampering first hand. “On voting day, our party representatives were thrown out of polling stations, threatened, and bribed in various parts of the country,” she said. “As an opposition party, not only do all the existing rules apply to you, but they’ll make up other ones as they go along,” she added.
That has continued in 2018 as well—leading opposition candidate Maurice Kamto alleged in front of the Constitutional Council that members of his party, the Cameroon Renaissance Movement, were chased out of polling stations this time around.
Kah Walla stayed the night Saturday at the Judicial Police in Douala to ensure the release of Barrister Michelle Ndoki and 42 other militants of Kamto’s MRC who were protesting aginst an “electoral holdup” in Cameroon.
The country’s Constitutional Council offers a 72-hour window for candidates to lodge complaints about the electoral process. But Biya appoints the members of the council, and complaints have to be heard before official results are released, leaving candidates without any evidence to substantiate their claims.
Nkongho Felix Agbor Balla, a high-profile Anglophone human rights lawyer who spoke in support of Kamto at the Constitutional Council, said that Biya stacked the courts in his favour against any electoral challenges.
He says the judges “cannot bite the fingers that feeds them, they cannot go against their master. These are people that would never allow Mr. Biya to lose an election.”
For years, Biya has stayed in power by co-opting elites who could potentially challenge him, undermining a fragmented opposition, and bending state institutions—including those overseeing the election—toward his own interests.
In part thanks to Biya’s agile maneuvering, few in the West were paying attention to Cameroon’s election.
But the stakes are higher in Biya’s seventh presidential run: Even as the fight against the Islamist militant group Boko Haram is winding down, with reportedly fewer than 1,000 active fighters in the country’s north, Cameroon still has to confront the distrust and displacement caused by the insurgency.
And it is now facing widespread political strife and conflict on another front that has taken aim at the country’s very foundation, the combination of French- and English-speaking regions into a single state. Biya has run a seemingly arrogant government, as observers will put it, with dialogue apparently alien to its agenda.
These deeper demographic divisions could eventually undermine Biya’s hold on power—though some experts expect the 85-year-old president to live out the rest of his life in office as the insurgency continues to smoulder, given the strength of Cameroon’s military.
Cameroon is fraying along a familiar seam—one that divides its about 6 million English-speaking citizens and its Francophone majority, which makes up around 80 percent of the country.
It’s an arrangement that has held since the creation of Cameroon—which emerged as an independent nation from colonial rule in 1961 when the area governed by British rule elected to join its French-speaking neighbours instead of Nigeria.
Experts say that in the decades since its independence, the government in Yaoundé has gradually chipped away at the rights and government support for its English-speaking citizens. “Since 1961, everything encompassing the Anglophone legal system, educational system, and identity has been diminished over time—to the point where Anglophones no longer recognize the entity in which they currently belong within the framework of today’s Cameroon,” said Christopher Fomunyoh, the director of the Africa program at the National Democratic Institute.
In the North West and South West Regions of the country, what started off in 2016 as protests from teachers and lawyers in the Anglophone regions pushing for more rights and support has transformed into an armed separatist movement.
Some Anglophones have gone as far as advocating for the creation of a separate state—Ambazonia—which they want to see split off from Francophone Cameroon entirely.
The Anglophone crisis has intensified to the point where gunfire and threats have nearly emptied entire towns. “Displacement is a very good indicator of trouble—people are leaving these areas because there is a lot of violence,” said Richard Moncrieff, the program director for Central Africa at the International Crisis Group.
The group, a nongovernmental organization that tracks conflict and crises around the world, has reported that as many as 300,000 people have fled their homes in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon.
The continuous government crackdown, which has seen about 4,000 people killed, has had dramatic political impact.
Voter turnout in the Anglophone regions fell to remarkable lows—to the extent that there was “nearly no election” in the North West and South West, according to autocratic politics expert Brett Carter—reflecting the almost universal distrust in Biya among the English-speaking population – Biya won big in both regions though, victory that greatly bothers Archbishop Kleda of the Douala Archdiocese.
“I don’t really think the government made much of a legitimate effort to make sure that Anglophone citizens voted,” said Carter, a professor at the University of Southern California. “It’s important for observers to understand the extent to which government violence over the past year and a half has reshaped the Cameroonian political landscape.”
Agbor Balla described the atmosphere on election day as he monitored polling stations in the South West Region: “The security presence in town was very intimidating … most people, who were scared of the military, decided to stay at home.” He added, “In one polling station, close to my house in Buea, at least 300 members of the military voted there.” He said.
The State Department has been treading lightly with its remarks about Cameroon’s election after a diplomatic uproar sparked by carefully couched comments from the U.S. ambassador, Peter Henry Barlerin, earlier this year.
In June, Barlerin suggested in a meeting with Biya the president “should be thinking about his legacy and how he wants to be remembered,” citing George Washington and Nelson Mandela as role models.
The government jumped on the comments, accusing him of criticizing Biya and trying to sway elections, and later several local media outlets alleged he paid $5 million to opposition candidates.
The U.S. Embassy called the claims “entirely false.”
Violence and longstanding rampant corruption have taken a heavy toll on Cameroon’s economy. But the country remains one of Central Africa’s most stable and economically significant countries.
And Paul Biya has consistently emphasized the relative stability of the country in comparison to its neighbors like the Central African Republic as a key platform for his re-elections. “For decades, Biya has run on a campaign of, ‘Look at our neighbours. Look at Nigeria, what a mess. Look at Chad, what a mess. We’re stable, we’re unified. We’re a strong country to be proud of,’” said Natalie Letsa, a scholar on sub-Saharan Africa at Stanford University. “I think that the Biya government is trying to keep that narrative alive the best they can, which is relatively easy given the lack of access to information in parts of the country.”
“Forty percent of the region’s economic output comes from Cameroon. It’s a highly important country in terms of its political influence and the influence that Biya has on neighbouring countries,” Smith said. “I think as Cameroon continues to regress, it’s going to continue to drag the rest of the region down.”
But for Biya to emerge from the 2018 election with no coherent plan to resolve conflict in the Anglophone regions will have far-reaching consequences.
On what grounds did Cameroonians – Biya got 71.28% of validly cast votes? Who can remember one concrete thing he said he will do within the next seven years aside hosting the African Cup of Nations in 2019?
Well, it’s another seven years for Biya – but what for?

0,"Armed Men Storm PSS Nkwen, Kidnap 79 Students, 3 Officials","November 5, 2018",by Mimi Mefo Takambou,"Bamenda residents are in total panic after suspected Ambazonian fighters stormed the Presbyterian Secondary School (PSS), Nkwen and kidnapped 79 students and three school officials early this Monday.
According to Mme Njie Maurine, Discipline Mistress of PSS Nkwen, 82 people were abducted; 79 students, the principal, the school bus driver and a teacher from CPC Bali.


Some students of the institution narrated that, the kidnappers who called themselve amba fighters, said they are not happy with their being in school.
Shortly after a brief meeting with some parents and staff at the school’s premises, Governor Adolphe Lele L’Afrique has assured the parents, that measures have been taken for a safe return of their children.
“Despite what happened today, the government will not surrender…we are going to make sure all those abducted are brought back to their classrooms…measures are being taken by security forces in that regard…,” Governor Adolphe Lele L’Afrique noted.

The governor further sent a warning signal to those he called terrorists…”I want to send a strong message to the terrorists…they are raping, killing, looting, abducting; but they are facing a powerful reaction from the power that be..not only here in Bamenda, but in the entire North West region of Cameroon…we cannot allow this to happen, schooling is a right. Let the world see the true face of these terrorists…,” the Governor continued.
Dozens of parents, in tears came to find out if their children are among the kidnappees.
Some doors of PSS Nkwen were destroyed during the early Monday November 5th attack.
Officials are still to have a clue on the whereabouts of the students.
But an online video, portrayed eleven students, indicating that, they were kidnapped on Sunday November 4th, and that their whereabout is unknown to them. “We will open our own school here…all of us will stay here and go to school here…and fight for this struggle until its over..” their alleged abductor behind the camara indicated.

Ambazonian leaders on their part have issued a release, condemning the attack at PSS Nkwen and abduction of the students. The release stated that, the kidnapping was carriedout by what they called impostors in the struggle. They added that findings are underway and called on those in keeping of the students to release them with immediate effect.
This is not the first attack on schools since the anglophone crisis escalated but this is the first time, such a such a huge number of students are kidnapped.
The incident has also raised alot of dust, on the security of students in schools promised by the government before the start of the 2018/2019 academic year.
Many have questioned how up to 79 students were successfully taken out of the school campus unnoticed.
Investigations are on course.

0,Parliamentary Session Opens : Deans Of The Two Houses Say Nothing New.,"March 13, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"2019 Legislative year has opened in Cameroon with the start of the March session of the parliament.
In respect to the standing orders of the National Assembly and the Senate, the oldest Member of Parliament and Senator respectively presides over activities before the election of the new executives.
At the National Assembly, the oldest Member of Parliament attests the house’s strong commitment to continue collaboration with the government to resolve the Anglophone crisis.
Hon. Enoh Tandjong declared that Ambazonia Separatist Fighters have been committing grievous crimes in the process of trying to carve out the state of the Ambazonia.
Hon. Enoh condemned the burning of Kumba District hospital recently.
To him, of no reason should medical facilities be attacked even in a crisis situation as that which Cameroon find itself today.
Following recent criticism of government’s handling of the Anglophone crisis by the US and the United Nations, Hon. Enoh Tandjong condemned what he described as the ‘hypocrisy of the international community’ in commenting on what is happening in Cameroon.
He applauded what government has been doing so far to resolve the crisis while challenging world bodies to contribute in the process of peace in Cameroon.
Away from the Anglophone crisis, the oldest MP saluted government’s drive to recover stolen state money and properties from former members of government.
Without condemning the fact that ex members of government are thrown to jail yet no money is recovered, Hon. Thinks the move is good to deter embezzlement in Cameroon.
At the senate, Senator Nfon Victor Mukete, oldest senator expressed hope in resolving the crisis with the reinforcement of the process of decentralization.
In the presence of Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute, the oldest senator in Cameroon expressed hope that the eminent organization of regional elections will boast the process of decentralization.
Just as his colleague at the national assembly, Senator Mukete condemned the terror in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon while criticizing those he thinks are holding arms illegally against the state of Cameroon.
Opposition Law Makers react:
Pronouncements from the oldest members of parliament during the opening of the session March 12th 2019, have been condemned by their colleagues of opposition parties.
According to Hon. Joseph Mbah Ndam of the Social Democratic Front (SDF), government has done nothing worth applauding in the process of resolving the crisis.
To the people’s representative from Momo Division, the fact that bloodshed is still the order of the day is a clear testimony of government’s failure so far.
To Hon. Patricia Ndam Njoya of the Cameroon Democratic Union CDU, decentralization has shown its limits in Cameroon for over twenty years.
She expressed regrets that government has not been serious in enforcing decentralization as real power still resides in Yaounde.
Commentators are waiting to see if in the days and weeks that follow real discussion can take place at the national assembly and the senate to resolve the crisis.

0,Dr. Nick Ngwanyam Says ‘Anglophone Peace Commission’ Workable,"March 11, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"One of the members of the newly created ‘Anglophone Peace Commission’ says the initiative will be a success.
Responding to some of the concerns raised by Mark Bareta, one of the ring leaders of the Ambazonian Movement, Dr. Nick Ngwanyam said:
“The Anglophone Peace Commission will be one of the biggest and most effective commissions, I Dr. Nick Ngwanyam do give you the Anglophones my word that these principles shall be respected at all times”.
He wrote:
Dear brothers and Sisters,
I like this name that has been suggested by Mr. Mark Bareta in reaction to the interview granted on Cameroon Calling this morning by two of our brothers speaking on behalf of a larger group seeking for peace in the Anglophone Regions of Cameroon.
As the secretary of the group, I will like to sincerely congratulate him for his sincere advice as we all seek for a meaningful way out of these senseless killings and slaughtering either way.
Mark is worried about the messenger. He thinks this messenger sleeps in the same bed with the powers that be and should not be trusted. He has a genuine right to feel that way and any right thinking person should feel that way as well. You need to ask questions and get the right answers so that no one takes you for a ride or for granted again.
Some have asked about the fruits of the many commissions created before to seek these same solutions. They have questions about the results of such including the Bilingualism Commission and more. Every right thinking person knows that you judge things not by their names but by their fruits..
We are very happy that Mr. Mark Bareta has suggested a wonderful and positive name under which we shall all operate; Anglophone Peace Commission. Thanks brother for being foresighted. The name we chose failed to see the points you raised and it was not intended to cloud anything nor was it a sign of fear to call a spade by its name. You know I always do; so that should not be an issue.
Our problems as Anglophones have to be addressed by Anglophones. We hope that after a ceasefire, we can move to a higher gear where the same problems are addressed by the concerned parties especially the government for a lasting solution to this crisis.
Anglophones are multicolored. They are CPDM, SDF, Grassfield, Forest/Coastal area ( Notice I avoided NW /SW), Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, women, children, men, women and all professions you can think of. There is a majority population of youths that are not working. They are disenchanted and feel lost because of no jobs and a lot of other issues. We are a mixed bunch.
The common thing to seek for as we speak to and with each other is to go for TRUTH and LOVE. We need to RESPECT LIFE and WORK ON PRINCIPLES.
If we are looking for things that divide us, there are baskets full of such. Let us look for that common ground and hold on that tread of hope. I agree with you that a lot of water has gone under the bridge but we all have a duty to stop loss.
No amount of killings, burnings, kidnappings for ransom, looting, raping, hate speech, name calling and what have you can make the situation better. The way forward to is to start to look for that faint light of peace through what we are all trying to do here in the name of all Anglophones born and unborn. It is our collective responsibility.
Who told them that there can be peace without justice?
I like this phrase of yours. You are right. If you remember I have been trying to illustrate several times through social media, TV and Radio how peace is a product of Truth. Justice is the process of reestablishing truth and paying reparation. There can NEVER BE PEACE WITHOUT JUSTICE. It is a principle that cannot be broken. Either way there must be justice.
…… check their neutrality….
I do understand that this is of great concern to you and many of our brothers and sisters out there and back here at home. We have had brothers and sisters here in high places before who spoke and lived for their stomachs and not our common good.
They actually fed these fires of hatred and spooked it. Even in the commission, we put this on the table as the first condition, TRUST AND NEUTRALITY. We had to arm-twist anyone who was not getting this new turn of events to understand that it was not business as usual. And we have gurus of both sides of the divide in the nouse.
It is the primordial condition for anything of substance to happen on the ground. TRUST is of the essence. Respect is her cousin. Truth and Love are the foundations.
I Dr. Nick Ngwanyam do give you the Anglophones my word that these principles shall be respected at all times. I will do my best to keep a watchful eye on them and would ring bells of caution if I notice the contrary. We shall collectively do our best as a winning team.
OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY.
The Anglophone Peace Commission will be one of the biggest and most effective commissions, that has ever existed in our land. This is so, because it belongs to the people. It is their channel of expression.
It runs across boundaries and involves EVERYBODY.
There is no exclusion. Everyone’s voice shall and MUST BE HEARD. From the villages, sub divisions and divisions; from all njangi groups, development groups, choirs and what have you. All of the Diaspora is part of it.
Mark, we count on you to be able to organize the positive thoughts to the ceasefire in Europe. I know you talk to Tapang Ivo, Eric Tataw, Chris Anu, Buh Herbert, Ayaba Cho Lucas and all the others that I cannot mention here. I know how you quarrel and insult each other but stay together for the good of humanity. Nobody is perfect here on earth. It is every body’s thing. No exclusions.
We need all hands on deck. We need all ideas to come forward so that we can get this cease fire to hold from our end and from the government side as well.
We should collectively take responsibility for this CEASEFIRE on both sides. This will truly pave the way for other DIALOGUES and NEGOTIATIONS to take place leading to a lasting solution as we continue to reason and talk in a civilized manner.
We beg and pray that the killings, maiming and burnings should stop.
It is the Lent season and the Bishops have called for a respect of life. May God the Almighty grant us his wisdom, guidance and protection. Be blessed.
As a closing remark, I will like to say that we cannot win if we do not go with the Lord. Abandoning him for other gods is a disaster.

Since the beginning of the Anglophone crisis in 2016, several commissions and committees have been created either by the government or individuals with supposed objectives to calm tension.
The North West/South West Peace Movement is the latest of such an initiative.
The perculiarity of this commission is that members have been drawn only from the North West and South West regions. The members are parliamentarians, medical doctors, journalist, opinion leaders, civil society activists, lawyers and the clergy.
The North West / South West Peace Movement Initiative, is championed by Hon.Enwe Francis Abi, member of parliament for Momo West constituency in the North West and Hon. NN Mbile from Ndian Division in the South West region.
These two key leaders of the peace Movement, are militants of the ruling Cameroon Peoples’ Democratic Movement (CPDM).
According to one of the members of the Peace Movement who preferred not to be named, the mission of the movement is to broker peace between Ambazonia frontline leaders and the government with a major goal of achieving lasting peace in Cameroon.
Members of the North West / South West Peace Movement intend to embark on a National and International tour to meet key actors in the conflict and explain the necessity for peace.
Questioned on the criteria for the selection of members of the committees, our source hinted “…I was mainly contacted by a close senior friend. That is how I attended the first meeting and since then all have been well.” On what the Peace Commission has been doing all this while, the member says “they have been strategizing”.
Who is Funding the NW/SW Peace Movement?
The initiative to put in place the NW/SW Peace Movement came to fruition shortly after the appointment Chief Dr. Joseph Dion Ngute Joseph as the Prime Minister of Cameroon on the 4th of January 2019.
The first meeting of the members took place at the luxurious five star Sawa Hotel in Douala.
For a day, members brainstormed on the formula to re institute peace in Cameroon. At the end of the meeting marked by expensive wine and good food, our source say surprisingly he was offered a hundred thousand francs with other members harvesting an undisclosed sums too.
The second meeting in the month of February in another expensive hotel in Yaounde. Similar sums were dished out to participants.
The key leaders during meetings have continuously mentioned the approval of the Prime Minister though no official document has been seen to back such a claims.
Controversy:
There already exist the national commission for the promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism.
President Paul Biya on several speeches has refer to the commission popularly called the ‘Musongue Commision’ as that responsible for bringing about peace in Cameroon.
In December 2018, the president created the Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration Committee headed by Fai Yengo Francis, to let fighters drop their arms and come back to normal life.
These bodies for now have nothing to point as achievements. Thus commentators are questioning the continuous use of tax payers money by both legal and clandestine committees, commissions or Movement when bloodshed is still the only language understood in the Anglophone regions by both the ambazonia fighters and the military.

0,Mile 4 Bonadikombo Limbe: Women Protest Over Water Crisis.,"March 9, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Women have staged a protest march demanding for the re-establishment of potable water.
They complain that for Over two months now, water has not been flowing in their taps despite having contributed 2000f for each room for necessary repair works by the Chairman of the water management committee.
Peter Wututu and his boys plus the quarter head are believed to have embezzled the money.
Another source in Mile 4 Limbe has hinted Mimi Mefo Info that money contributed for the provision of water was instead diverted for the security of the community.
To this source, those who collected the money claimed they handed it to the Ambazonian fighters. But the fighters have refused haven collected the money. The Amba boys have therefore accused the mile 4 water management project team of embezzling twenty one million francs cfa.
In the state of accusation and counter accusation between the Ambazonian Fighters and the water management team, the population continues to live without potable water.
Some inhabitants have been blaming Cameroon Water Utility corporation (CAMWATER) in charge of distribution water for not shouldering its responsibility.
They explain how they have been fetching water from doubtful sources for drinking and other house hood chores.
A similar water crisis is being experienced in some quarters like New Lay out and Great Soppo in Buea still in the South West region of Cameroon.
Inhabitants here say the last time they harvested water from their taps was in December 2018.
Mile 4 Limbe has of recent been a battle ground between the angloghone militiamen called the ambazonia.

0,"North West Region: Timid Women’s Day Celebration, Military And Para Military Women Braved The Odds .","March 8, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The streets of Bamenda remained deserted Friday March 8th 2019 .
Most of the women either by personal conviction of the worthlessness of celebrating international women’s day this year or compelled to respect a ghost town imposed by pro independence fighters, and had to stay in their houses.

The rather timid celebration marked by march past activities at the commercial Avenue, saw the presence and participation of mostly military and para military women’s groups that braved the odds to take part in the 34th edition of the international women’s day.
March past at the commercial avenue lasted just for a few minutes in the presence of heavily armed military men. Adolph Lele L’Afrigue governor of the north west called on women to tell their children who have become amba fighters to return to normal life.
Women on their part said they are tired of bloodshed in the region and want an end to the anglophone crisis.
In kumbo, Bui Division situated kilometres from Bamenda, residents attested having heard sounds of gunshots during the greater part of March 8th. They say shootings took place around Saint Peters, squares and Bamkikaay village. This scared most women from steping out of their homes to celebrate women’s day.
A similar scenario unfolded in Nkambe, Donga Mantung Division where Ambazonian fighters had earlier issued a special warning for people to stay in the houses.
Given that 11 February celebration was a success in the town, amba boys have been very critical on the activities of people in the town, which they qualify as pro government.

0,Trial Of Sisiku Ayuk Tabe And Co Suffers Another Adjournment – Presence Of Fru Ndi Causes Commotion.,"March 7, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The trial of Ayuk Tabe Julius Sisiku and Co has been adjourned to the 29th of March 2019.
The time is to permit the new judge appointed this week Lt. Col. Jacques Boudoin Misse Njone to constitute a new team that will re start the trial.
The chairman of the Social Democratic Front Ni John Fru Ndi was in court today. He was at the centre of attraction as it was his first appearance at the military court since the trial of the Ambazonian leaders began.
He is expected to visit the detainees in the days ahead.
Ayuk Tabe Sesiku Julius and nine others refused to leave the court room when forces of law and order attempted to stop friends and relatives from greeting them. the request of the detainees was later granted.
The Intrigues:
Colonel Mem Michel, the presiding judge of the case of Ayuk Tabe Julius and Co was transferred to Buea Military court this week.
Lawyers explain that this automatically means he cannot longer handle cases in Yaounde.
Defending lawyers of Ayuk Tabe and Co have accused the court of partiality.
They argue that given the delicate nature of the trial Col. Mem was not to be transferred at this point in time.
According to bar. Ndong Christopher one of the lawyers of the detainees the transfer of the presiding judge is a calculated attempt to delay the verdict of their clients.
The lawyers they will only present the verdict of Abuja High Court that demanded the re extradition of the detainees during the next court case on the 29th of March.

0,Stakes And Prospects As Sisiku Ayuk Tabe & Co. In Court Today,"March 7, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Leaders of the Interim Government of the Ambazonia Federal Republic will again be at the Military Tribunal in Yaounde.
Today’s hearing will be unfolding within a unique context – the ruling from Nigeria, the transfer of the presiding military judge and remarks from the US Assistant Secretary of State in charge of African Affairs.
Defense Lawyers for Ayuk Tabe and Co. will seek the implementation of a court ruling from the Abuja Federal High Court in Nigeria last week.
The trial today equally comes on the heels of the release of the ‘Ambazonia Freedom Protocol’: a charter manifesto signed by the interim leaders detained at the kondengui prison.
In the document they expressed determination to ensure the total independence of Ambazonia Republic or resistance forever – Wilfred Tassang strangely did not sign the February 28 document.

0,Oku- Who is fueling Extra-Judicial killings? Fai Yengo Francis accused of buying-off Amba Fighters,"March 5, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"There have been cases of targeted killings in Oku Sub Division, Bui Division of the North West Region of Cameroon, a resident of the village in anonymity has told Mimi Mefo Info.
In his words “…two women were caught by a vigilante group and handed over to the military for summary execution. The crime of the women was that they could not speak the native Oku language and thus believed to be spies of the Anglophone militiamen called Ambazonia fighters.”
Our source further states that people believed to be loyal to the government of Cameroon have been offered ten thousand francs cfa each, as financial motivation to denounce and report any one that have a link with the ambazonia fighters to the military.
Other sources in Oku indicate that one suspected ambazonia militia camp has been bought over by authorities and the fighters secretly lay their arms while another ambazonia camp still in the village have turned down all financial and material temptations from the state for them to willingly surrender their arms and return to normal life.
This has increased tension in the village.
Inhabitants of Oku have been attesting that one of their sons Fai Yengo Francis has masterminded the project of stamping out Ambazonia fighters in the village that has brought untold misery on them.
Fai Yengo Francis is the president of the national commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR).
The commission created in December 2018 by president Paul Biya has as a main responsibility to disarm and reintegrate people that have taken arms against the state of Cameroon.
To the villagers, Fai Yengo Francis a former top civil administrator in President Paul Biya’s government and today president of DDR wants to set an example of the mission of the DDR commission by putting an end to the fight for the restoration of Ambazonia statehood in his native Oku village.
Contacted on phone by Mimi Mefo Info on Tuesday March 5th 2019, to comment on the accusations on the Commission of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, the President Fai Yengo Francis responded saying “…they are giving 10.000f for what? I know nothing about that and I am not aware of anything as such. It is not true.I live in Yaounde and therefore do not understand what is happening in Oku…”.
As the reporter insisted that the information of extra judicial killings in the process of fighting ambazonia boys in Oku has been given by the villagers, Mr Fai retorted “…please Mr.Journalist crosscheck your information .It’s not true”.
As the tension intensify in Oku village, villagers have fled to bushes for safety.

0,After Winning Mount Cameroon Race: Mbatcha Eric Mangeh Gets Mounting Pressure To Support The Struggle,"March 1, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The winner of 2019 Mount Cameroon Race of Hope under pressure to support the struggle for the restoration of Ambazonia statehood. Mbacha Eric Mangeh 2019 winner in the men’s category has stated “… I have been receiving calls from unidentified people asking me to support the struggle for the restoration of ambazonia republic. The calls have not stated any specific amount and I have not stated an answer.“
The 36-year-old athlete from Mbot village, Donga Mantung Division in the North West Region of Cameroon explains that besides asking for financial support, his life or that of his family has not been threatened as rumored on the social media.
Mbacha Eric Mangeh bagged ten millions francs cfa for arriving the first position at the end of the race at the Molyko omnisport stadium in Buea, which amount is subject to 11% tax deduction.
Other winners of the race both in the men and women category contacted have not received similar calls like Mbatcha Eric.
Mbacha Eric Mangeh trained in Noun Division in the West region of Cameroon for the race this year given the high level of insecurity in his native Donga Mantung Division and the two Anglophone regions of Cameroon in general.
Mount Cameroon Race of Hope took place in Buea on Saturday 23rd February under very tight security as Ambazonia separatists earlier threatened to disrupt activities marking the 24th edition of the Race of Hope.

0,"A lockdown of pain and misery ebbs away -Health Care, Education, Business In Jeopardy","February 15, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"7:30am at Mile 6 Nkwen, in the restive North West Region of Cameroon, Sonita (as she would prefer to be called) wakes up tired and weary.
Her unstable physical health condition made it impossible for her to walk more than five metres from her home.
The final year student of the University of Bamenda took ill just hours after Pro-Independence Fighters announced a lock down of all public and private activities in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon.
“I am unwell; I will only have to wait for the 11-day lock down to end since there is no means for me to go to the hospital. I have no choice,” she told Mimi Mefo Info in a rather faint voice, which revealed her health condition.
Sonita is not the only one affected by the two weeks temporary restrictions of movements and business activities by the pro-separatists, fighting for independence of the two English-speaking regions of Cameroon for over three years now.
Such cases abound!
Families have lost loved ones because of the lockdown, as transporting patients to hospitals remains problematic.
A driver of one of the ambulances in Bamenda said:
“At 8:00am we receive the first call, and by noon, we had transported six cases to the hospital. We cannot tell exactly how many people we transport to the hospital, but not everyone can benefit from our services,” he said.
As Mimi Mefo Info approached the Regional Hospital in Bamenda on the fifth day of the lockdown, we caught up with a woman in tears.
“I am coming from the mortuary, my sister just lost her baby because we could not get to the hospital in time,” she explained.
On the first week of the lock down, personnel of the Bamenda Regional Hospital were on their way to meet up with emergency cases at the hospital, when, they were attacked at Mile 8 Mankon, Bamenda II subdivision by unknown gunmen.
In another quarter in Nkwen, a student is worried about her career.
She said classes have been constantly disrupted and that, the lockdown made things worst.
Hear her:
“The lockdown has really affected me. According to the school program, I have exams on Tuesday but I can’t study properly since we have not been able to meet with the lecturer for directives.”
“The tense atmosphere, with constant shootings is not also a suitable atmosphere for concentration and studies,” intimated Sonia, another university student.
Business activities grounded
Several shops were ravaged by flames at the Bamenda Commercial Avenue.
The flames broke out in broad daylight on February 7th, 2019 “I only learned about the incident on TV since we have been stuck indoors. The fire emanates from a garbage can, placed along one of the streets behind the Bamenda Main Market by the waste disposal company. Due to the stench from the dustbin, unknown individuals were forced to burn the garbage. The fire unfortunately extended to some nearby locked up shop,” Nji John, a local authority revealed to Mimi Mefo Info.
But MMI is still to establish whether the inferno was an accident or an arson attack.
While scores of youths were arrested and detained in Buea, many in other parts of the two Anglophone regions lost their lives.
-In Bole Bakundu, at least 20 youths died after soldiers reportedly opened fire in the market.
-At least five persons were shot dead in Muyuka last week.
-One person was shot dead in Wututu purportedly by soldiers
-One person shot dead at travellers.
-Nine other injured victims were rushed to the hospital.
-A man was shot in a crossfire in Kumba
-Three bodies were discovered in Banya
-Four people died after the District Hospital in Kumba was set on fire.
Cameroonian authorities and Amba boys have continued to blame each other for masterminding the “arson” attack.
-A soldier was beheaded in Buea by suspected Ambazonian fighters
-An officer of the Limbe Naval Base, Mbonde Emmanuel was killed by purported pro-independence fighters.
-Five soldiers were injured in a gun battle in Wum
-Close to a dozen soldiers were wounded along the Buea-Kumba motorway.
-Close to ten vehicles set on fire with several homes destroyed and properties lost.
Many like Barrister Agbor Balla, Ayah Ayah Abine criticised the lockdown, arguing that it has devastating consequences on the already embattled population.
But Ambazonian fighters have said sending a strong signal to the Biya regime and to the international community by boycotting February 11th and showing support for their detained leaders in Yaounde was imperative.

0,"Soldiers Continue To Torture, Kill Ex-Amba Fighters","March 30, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Despite assurances from Interior Minister Paul Atangana Nji that repentant Ambazonian fighters will be well treated, security forces are executing another agenda.
Several ex-fighters are said to be detained in unmarked locations, while many others have been killed.
Today in Bangshie, Medankwe village in Bamenda I Subdivision, two ex-fighters were manhandled by the forces, Mimi Mefo info has learnt.
A source said: “These two young men, Amando and Abamukong, were arrested on Tuesday by troops stationed to protect a government building erected by the Chinese.
“They were arrested for non possession of ID cards and tortured as usual. It so happened that one of those boys was with the restoration forces for a few months and his grand father paid for him to be freed from being a part of the restoration forces. He left, got Yaounde but after some months, he came back to visit his mom. He had openly withdrawn himself from being a fighter.
“Unfortunately, someone told the military that he used to be a fighter who left and stopped fighting.
“Instead of trying to rehabilitate him and his friend as the Cameroon Government claims, they were tortured with machetes. His grand father came to his rescue and he was also tortured. The old man cannot walk. Right now the families are not sure where those boys are.
“So, if the boys decide to lay down arms, will they be slaughtered.”
On November 30th 2018, President Paul Biya created a national committee for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former Boko Haram fighters in the far north and former separatist fighters in northwest and southwest regions.
But the committee is still to yield expected results.

0,"Chomba, Nsongwa At Dangers Drawn! -Leaked confidential letter from Nsongwa Fon to Atanga Nji nails Chomba Fon for housing secessionists","March 26, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"With the Anglophone crisis deepening further in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon, relations between the two neighboring villages of Chomba and Nsongwa in Mezam Division, North West region are at their worst.
It is an atmosphere of suspicion and feeling of betrayal that reigns between villagers of these neighboring villages, following the leak of a confidential letter against the Fon of Chomba, allegedly sent to the Minister of territorial administration by the Fon of Nsongwa.

The said letter dated 31st October, 2018, accuse the Fon of Chomba of housing and collaborating with Ambazonian fighters. The letter supposedly from Fon Fonguh Emmanuel FONGWADE of Nsongwa said they have been rampantly harassed by some unknown guys allegedly from neighboring Chomba Village and they have reliable information that the individuals are working in association with the Fon of Chomba.
Another huge accusation carried by the confidential letter to Minister Paul Atanga Nji is that ammunitions are buried under the Chomba palace to be consequently used against Nsongwa village and other neighboring villages, considered as threat to Chomba.
The writer further claimed that the Fon of Chomba has been harbouring Amba boys and has dispatched some to neighboring Nigeria for training in order to reinforce threats against potential Chomba enemies.
Citing a group called “Mbachongwa Ambazonian Forces” led by a certain General Ivo the supposed Fon of Nsongwa in his letter said they came to him home for support, and indicated that they were working in collaboration with the Fons of Chomba and Mbatu villages in the Mezam.
Four months after the confidential letter which demanded the intervention of the Minister of Territorial Administration, Paul Atanga Nji, His Royal Highness Fon Fonguh
Emmanuel FONGWADE issued a disclaimer to Minister Paul Atanga Nji on February 6th 2019.

The Fon of Nsongwa said the letter written on the 31st of October 2018, was not written by him or anybody representing him.
The traditional ruler of Nsongwa in a letter that looks different from the former both in form and format, said the former has nothing to do with him or his chiefdom, because he is a man of peace, a Christian and will never for any reason, do anything to hurt a person, especially a neighbor with whom they have lived together forever and have a lot in common.
Both communities have witnessed destruction and chaos like most communities in the conflict hit North West and South West regions, and it remains a mystery who is fanning a conflict among the villages which have seen their worst already.
Chomba, Nsongwa and Mbatu villages have also had a bitter taste of the war in these regions with a very unstable security atmosphere.
Hate and inter tribal tendencies is already becoming a serious Crisis in Cameroon, including the trouble hit regions.
There have been reports of strained relations between the indigenous people of the North West and some tribes in the region.

0,"Firebrand Senator, Barrister Kemende Henry Weeps For Balikumbat!","March 22, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Barrister Kemende Henry Gamsey, Senator of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) party for the North West constituency has in an emotional letter captured the worries of the people of his native Balikumbat in Ngoketunjia Division of Cameroon’s North West Region.
“The over twenty thousand people in the village do not have access to medical care after the medication centre was transformed into a military barrack over five months ago,” the people’s representative writes in a tear-provoking note.

Senator Kemende in one of his questions directed to the Minister of Public Health asked: “Concerning the Balikumbat Hospital in the Ngoketunjia Division of the North West region, which premises has been transformed into a barrack, what is your ministry doing to either reestablish that medical facility or transfer same elsewhere for the health personnel to return in order that the local population can have access to health facilities?”

Doctors and nurses have escaped to safer towns and villages since the military invaded the hospital on September 27th 2018.
“I could not continue working there because my life was at risk. We took the oath to save lives, but the government forces will attack and intimidate us for treating ambazonian fighters. I couldn’t stay there any longer. Most of my colleagues left weeks after for their safety… ” a nurse from Balikumbat who is now seeking refuge in Bamenda tells Mimi Mefo info.
Calls for the government to come to the people’s aid have been fruitless. Locals testify that the lone clinic in the village was also attacked.
“The population of this locality are suffering because there’s no hospital. People are dying because there’s no hospital and I am pleading on you on behalf of the suffering population of BALIKUMBAT to let the world know about this.
The lone private clinic in Balikumbat was also damaged by this same military. And all the doctors and nurses have escaped for their safety and some of the nurses who were natives of Balikumbat were helping the pregnant women,” a resident recounted to Mimi Mefo Info.
Pregnant women now give birth in homes or in bushes with very slim chances of survival.
The sick do not have access to medical care.
The government has maintained sealed lips as it is yet to explain to Cameroonians why a hospital meant to serve the people, became a military barrack.
Since the start of the socio-political crisis in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon, dozens of public health services have either been attacked or forced to close down as health care workers flee to safety.
The SDF Senator of the North West constituency, has asked to know how many of the affected public health services have been rehabilitated and made functional.

0,20 Students Of The University Buea Still In The Hands Of kidnappers,"March 21, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Over twenty four hours after the Kidnapping of 20 students of the University Buea South West region of Cameroon, nothing has filtered from the security service on the where about of the students.
Residents of the town of Buea and other neighboring towns testify having seen military helicopters during the evening hours of Wednesday flying in a suspected search mission.
The vice chancellor of the University of Buea has confirmed the incident to a CNN correspondent.
To professor Ngono Horace Manga, armed men took away twenty students that were training ahead of the University games.
According to the head coach of the University of Buea football club, the situation is a traumatizing one.
In a telephone interview with Mimi Mefo Info, Nicolas Asongu states “…I had an accident on Tuesday and I was not suppose to attend the training session on Wednesday, the day of the incident.
Students who witnessed the incident only informed me later. They said armed men arrived the field and ordered the players to go with them.
The kidnappers later called me demanding money before the release of the students but we are still negotiating on the possibilities of their release without payment”.
The Post, a Buea based newspaper in its Thursday March 21st publication has reported that the kidnappers are demanding the sum of four million francs cfa as ransom for the release of the students.
At the moment, seven farmers have been arrested in connection to the kidnap. Esungwe Christian a son of one of the women arrested has stated:
“My mother and other people were working on their farms situated not too far from the scene of the kidnap. So when the military men came in search of the kidnappers, they arrested all them. They are under detention at the judicial police station in Buea”
Why the Kidnap?
No group has officially claimed responsibility of the kidnap of 20 students of the University of Buea as of now. Despite this, there is a general perception that the act has been carried out by Anglophone militiamen called the Ambazonia boys.
They have been fighting for the restoration of Ambazonia statehood since 2016.
As one of their key strategy to press for independence, the fighters have since 2017 called for the closure of all schools in the North West and south west regions of Cameroon as a means to paralyze the control of the government of Cameroon on the two restive North West and South West Regions.
The kidnap of the 20 students is the highest number taken from the institution since the beginning of the crisis but this is not the first time as two other lecturers were kidnapped from the campus and later released.
Buea remains a battle ground between the amba boys and the military as the restorationists hold that conquering Buea will mean the attainment of independence from the Republic of Cameroon.
The government has maintained that it is not ready to engage a dialogue platform with what it called “terrorists”, despite ceaseless domestic and international pressure for an inclusive dialogue.
President Paul Biya and his government believe that effective decentralisation (which has failed for over twenty two years), is the solution.
Meanwhile opposition leaders like Barrister Akere Muna, Doctor Christopher Fomunyuy, Edith Kah Wallah have underscored the need for a dialogue on the form of the state.

0,The Violation of 1996 Constitution: Causing Political Conflict In Cameroon – Tibor Nagy.,"March 20, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"“The people of Cameroon will feel safe if given the chance to exercise political power like the opportunity to elect local representatives that include the governors”. Tibor Nagy, US assistant Secretary of state in charge of African Affairs has stated in an exclusive interview granted to Canal 2 International Television in Cameroon.
To the US diplomat, the partial implementation of the 1996 constitution in Cameroon is the root cause of all socio-political and economic problems that have resulted to a full armed conflict in the North West and south west regions of Cameroon.
Mr. Tibor posits that an efficient implementation of decentralization is the way out of the violence.
On the question of who the country of Donald Trump thinks is responsible for the manslaughter and destruction in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, the US assistant secretary of state says America has received conflicting reports from the government of Cameroon and separatist fighters.
To him, many have died with enormous material destructions recorded with innocent population of the North West and South West suffering the effects of Ambazonia/military atrocities.
He regrets that basic social facilities like schools, hospitals and others have been shut down with workers fleeing for their lifes.
The US envoy expressed concerns that the situation has gotten worst to a point where civilians in the restive regions no longer trust the military and other forces of law and order.
For this, he acknowledged the sovereignty of Cameroon as an independent country but warns that the earlier the problem is resolved the better for Cameroon.
The Kamto Affair:
The arrest and detention of militants of the Cameroon Renaissance Party most especially professor Maurice Kamto has equally attracted the attention of US. On the trial of the militants,Tibor says “…the perception at the international community is that the militants have been arrested for their political activities. We will see what the judiciary in Cameroon will say. But as you know, perception is often reality”.
The straight forward nature of the US assistant secretary of State in the course of the exclusive interview on Canal 2 Television, political commentators say speaks volumes of what he discussed with President Paul Biya at the unity palace this week.

0,Anglophone Crisis: ‘A day no one is killed is strange’– Cardinal Tumi.,"March 19, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"“As we drove from Bamenda to Kumbo, we saw two or three corpses along the road. In Kumbo, residents told me eight people were killed that day adding that the military and Ambazonia fighters kill people on daily bases».
Christian Cardinal Tumi explains in a low voice filled with grieve and agony after visiting his homeland kumbo, Bui Division, North West Region of Cameroon.
To the Cardinal, what was before now considered abnormal is now normal unfortunately. The military and those fighting for the restoration of Ambazonian statehood have been reigning terror on the local population, he said.
Visiting Bui Division with a prime intention to celebrate Sunday mass with catholic Christians in his native Kikaikilaiki village, the Cardinal saw his dream shattered:
“…I could not go to Kikaikilaiki to celebrate mass and pray with the people. Ambazonia fighters ordered that on Sunday March 17 2019 they do not want to see any vehicle in the village including that of the Cardinal. So I had to remain in Kumbo against my wish”
Questioned on how he think the crisis can come to an end, called on both warring factions to lay their arms. “…dialogue in times of war is not an option but an obligation”.
While criticizing the military on their wrong doing, Cardinal Tumi described amba boys and separatist leaders in the Diasporas as people that have “No intellectual openness”.
He explained that they do not accommodate different opinions apart from what they have as concerns the struggle. While quoting the threats by Amba boys to kill Dr. Simon Munzu for involving himself in the process of negotiating peace, the Cardinal called for a change of mentality for peace.
The respectable personality in Cameroon stated firmly that whatever will be the outcome of the Anglophone crisis, it will spring from a dialogue table.
The Anglophone General Conference on Course:
The organization of Anglophone General Conference (AGC) is under preparation despite several delays.
Without mentioning if conveners of the AGC have finally secured an authorization from the government of Cameroon to hold the conference, Cardinal Tumi is optimistic that the move towards peace will take place.
To the Cardinal, a meeting of conveners to hold on the 23th of March will set the date and venue of the Anglophone General Conference AGC.
The Cardinal assured that intense consultations have been carried out with Anglophones in the Diaspora with the team to present their report of the tour on the 23rd of March.
Anglophone General Conference is organized by religious leaders with Cardinal Tumi as a leader.

0,"All Cameroonians Are Prisoners, And The Current War Is Evil – Nick Ngwanyam","March 18, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Following the creation of the the Anglophone Peace movement for the cessation of Violence, anglophones from all works of life have been channeling their concerns, sometimes very emotional, to members. Dr Nick Ngwanyam MD, Secretary General of the Movement, here reacted to two disturbed anglophones, Greg from Kondengui Prison, on the difference between Dialogue and negotiation, and Dr Zama who had disturbing questions on justice and Reparation between parties in the war.
To Greg, an Anglophone from Manyu currently detained in Kondengui Prison and who questioned the view of the Anglophone Peace Movement for the Cessation of violence, on Dialogue and negotiations, Dr Nick here wrote.
I have never been to a physical prison as a prisoner.
But I lived in a Spiritual prison of devil worship for a long time from birth till sometime in 1979 when I met a friend who pointed out to me that being afraid of witches and wizards was the greatest mistake anyone could make in his life. She showed me the way of the cross.
I was a Presbyterian until that time from CPC Bali. I had been worshipping in the Baptist church at some point in JMBC.
In the 3rd year in CUSS I became a Catholic with the help on this friend and she helped me to put my foot on my fear.
That is the day I left prison at age 23.
All Cameroonians are prisoners in one way or the other..
I learnt something that was very interesting.
You can be a very strong person and start a fight with someone that is weaker.
The strong man will knock the weaker person to the ground.
The interesting thing here is that for the strong man to pin the weak man to the ground this strong man must stay at ground level with his victim.
Incidentally the common thing is that both of them are on the ground.
The strong man cannot carry on his daily activities but he is spending time and resources to pin the weak person to the ground. Both of them are losers as the world moves on.
Our souls are made up of three functional parts:
the mind, our will power
Our emotions , which are under the control of the spirit beings in us.
If you harbour the devil you think evil and execute evil which is deceitful and destructive.
The current war is evil fought with ODESHI and the other EVIL spirits from Europe .
The Spirit of the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that created the heaven and earth is the Only source of Justice truth Peace and Love.
We do not have any justification for killing people on each side of the divide and soaking our land with blood.
We are all in prison because of the blood we shed.
We are in prison because of the lies we all tell.We are in prison because we bear false witness against others.
We are in prison because we are greedy. We steal from the orphan and the widow. We break the morale of the weak. We take away his hope and lock his mind in a prison of despair.
We are too full of our own ego that robs us of humility. We become boastful and fail to listen to each other. We fail to see reason why others should breathe the same free air and that can be very dangerous.
Where Justice and Peace are absent,
Where everyone lives in fear. A giant prison is created be it in our homes, work place, communities or nation.
That said, I know you are physically in Prison in Kondengui.
If you think like Paul, your body is locked up in prison yet your Spirit is free because of the Big God that lives in you.
Before I go there are five very strong emotions that control us.
Two are very Powerful positively,love, faith
The negative and destructive ones are..
anger , fear and I just forgot the fifth one. You can fill in yourself . Hate?
Have a wonderful day. Keep the faith. The Lord is good all the time and stay blessed. Peace be with you.
Turning the other cheek is an expression which means ‘go the extra mile’. Christ did by dying on the cross.
Dr Zama, advanced worries on Justice and Reparation, especially regarding what has been destroyed in the war in the North West and south west regions.
Dr Nick here wrote
Many people share the same concerns and worries like you and we need to actually face the music to get out of this endless tunnel.Most of what you say is true but there are some half truths and traps therein for people who do not know what half truths look like.
Most of the factual things you mentioned are verifiable.When you drive into the philosophical realm you run into serious problems.Christ says we should think the truth speak the truth live the truth do what is true and good and we shall be set free from bondage.If we are in bondage now then we have been lying and living in falsehood here and elsewhere.
The government has not spoken beautiful truth always.The Ambazonians and their leadership have been fighting each other because of lies, poor governance, accountability, ego problems, financial problems, power struggle and the encouragement of Odeshi and garri business.
The military has been doing a lot that needs to be looked into.The three different kinds of Ambas have been doing things that are not entirely holy..
Youth have been killed and old mothers burnt alife. We have seen pictures.How much can one pay for a single soul that is lost. How much would you like to pay for one head that is cut off.
How much can we pay for burnt hospitals and children who have not gone to school for three years.
Who is committing all these evil acts and
in whose name.
Both sides are to blame for this is a senseless war due to lack of dialogue. Kingdom principles are, absolute truth is of the Lord. When you operate in God’s Kingdom he will lead you and show you truths. Only the Spirit does that. Peter told Jesus you are the Christ and Jesus said only the Spirit could have revealed it to you.
Outside of the Kingdom the devil uses three other forms of supposed truth with which he deceived so as to kill.These are Half truths
Oncogenic truth
And another concept that just skipped my mind.
We have all been living in sin and have fallen short of the glory of God.
Many of you are out there that have swindled money from the Cameroon treasury and are still doing so.
Many went out on false papers, on false charges of rape and torture.
Many ran out there and are hiding because you borrowed money from credit unions and individuals and could not pay back
How many of you men and women out there and here at home have killed unborn children through abortion
How many of you go to work on Sundays to earn dollars instead of going to worship God your creator and how many of you are 419?
How many of you have refused to come home and bury your parents?
How many of you are leading broken homes?
When a plane takes off it has a reference point on the ground as it flies to its destination.
That land Mark or marks are fixed because they represent Truth.
If the pilot misses out on this the plane is lost for there is no reference.
Love Truth Justice and Peace have only one stem from which the philosophy is defined. The Kingdom of God.
If you try to set your own court with your own standards you will fail woefully. Christ says forgive seventy seven times 7 times.
Life had no price. All sins have one price which is death.
But God bought us over. That is what lent is all about. You cannot pay God for that abortion you committed or that man you betrayed and lied against in court.
If we try to seek reparation and Justice according to the world it does not exist.
If you tell me how much you are willing to pay for the child ‘you’ killed in an abortion I will be able to use that reference and work out the mathematics.
I am sorry is the greatest word under the Sun.

0,"Meluf, Bajing, Wum villages – Houses Set Ablaze, People Killed.","March 15, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Houses have been burnt in Meluf village, Kumbo sub Division of the North West region of Cameroon.
Inhabitants have fled to bushes and other neighbouring villages for safety.
The victims have been recounting on phone that people dressed in military uniforms of the Cameroonian army, invaded the village at about 4:30am Friday March 15 causing the havoc.
On the number of people killed, no number has been established for now but those who succeeded to escape say the old and children of the village stand high risk of death.
This is the second time Meluf village has been set ablaze since the beginning of the year 2019, with no investigation carried out by competent authorities in Cameroon.
Residents of Bamkikaay, a neighboring village to those attacked,say they could spot thick smoke in the skies of the villages and got sounds of gun shots.
Beside Meluf, the raid got to other quarters like Fikov and Ntarmi.
Residents of Kikaikom, Taadu, Mbiim and other surrounding quarters have fled to bushes for fear of similar attacks.
In Wum still in the north west region of Cameroon, at least four people are reported dead as they could not escape a huge fire believed to have been ignited by the Cameroonian military. The inhabitants say the attack was in search of ambazonia boys that have been using such villages as hide outs.
Children and women have been wailing calling on God to intervene. They complain that the sacredness of man no longer have a value in the restive Anglophone regions of Cameroon.

0,Cameroon: A Laboratory For Human Right Violation – US State Department.,"March 14, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"Cameroon has distinguished herself in the domain of human rights violation in 2018.
The US state department has published its 2018 Human Rights report on Cameroon.
The 45 page report duels on human rights abuses perpetrated in the course of the Anglophone crisis in the North West and South West Regions and the war against book Haram insurgency in the Far North Region.
The report points cases of arbitrary and unlawful killings by the military and Anglophone militia men called the Ambazonian Fighters in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.
To illustrate this, the report mentioned the brutal killings of twenty seven civilians in Menka village Santa sub division of the North West region of Cameroon by the military.
A similar unlawful killing of Thomas Ashu Nkongho principal of Government Bilingual High School Kossala – Kumba and the Divisional Officer for Batibo by separatist forces called the Ambazonians.
The disappearance of people equally constitutes a key aspect of human rights violation in Cameroon according to the report of US State department.
The report indicates that bodies of those who disappear were later found along the streets and bushes either fresh or in a stage of decomposition.
This mostly happened to people who were suspected of supporting the fight for the restoration of Ambazonian statehood.
In Kumba South West region of Cameroon, the president of a local Human Rights Non Governmental Organization called Frontline Fighters for Citizens Interest (FFCI) disappeared.
Mr. Franklin Mowha was kidnapped on the 6th of August 2018 as he set out to investigate human rights violation in Kumba.
Torture of both civilians and detainees was practiced by government agents and the military to silent those critical of the regime.
The report of US State department on human rights violation in Cameroon, laments that government has seldom taken measures to investigate such crimes but punishments have never been made public thus giving room to impunity.
Beside arbitrary arrest of people and poor detention conditions, the government of Cameroon in the year 2018 did not pay financial compensation as stipulated by the law to hundreds of people arrested and detained for months without any reason and later released.
Long detention period without trial:
The report quotes among other cases the detention of Ayuk Tabe Julius Sisiku and other leaders of the self proclaimed state of Ambazonia for nine months incommunicado under deplorable conditions.
This, the report concludes retards trial process and thus, obliges people to suffer unjustly.
In the domain of press freedom in Cameroon in the year 2018, US state department noticed that journalists who reported on the atrocities of the military were hunted and arrested arbitrary. The report quotes the detention and later condemnation of Thomas Awah Junior of Aghem Magazine, Akumbom Elvis and many others.
The government of Cameroon failed in its role of ensuring property restitution to people who saw both landed and movable property destroyed in the process of executing government’s projects.
An increase in the number of political prisoners, poor and long periods of trials and denial of fair trial aggravated human rights violations in Cameroon in the year 2018 .
This has urged some political commentators to describe Cameroon as a laboratory of human rights violation in 2018.

0,NORTH WEST/SOUTH WEST: Lenten Pastoral Letter Denounces The Profanation Of Human Dignity.,"March 14, 2019",by Mimi Mefo Info,"The sacredness and dignity of human life is no longer respected in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon since the 21st of November 2016.
In a Lenten Pastoral letter to Christians and the people of Cameroon, the archbishop and auxiliary bishop of Bamenda in the North West decry the triviality under which human beings and the dead are treated in these restive regions.

As concerns human beings, the letter signed by Bishop Cornilius Fontem Esua Archbishop and Bishop Michael Miabesue Bibi Auxiliary bishop of Bamenda, human beings prey on one another with the rampant profanation and disrespect of human life and dignity.
The north west and the south west have been marked by daily violence characterized by confrontations between the military and ambazonia fighters. These two groups, the Catholic men of God say have no respect for man, the ultimate creature of God Almighty.
Quoting Genesis 1:27 “God created man in the image of himself, in the image of God who created him male and female he created them”, the archbishop and the auxiliary bishop of Bamenda illustrate how the life of man created in the image of God no longer has value in the eyes of those who kill.
In the mist of tension between the military and Ambazonia fighters, innocent civilians are killed with impunity.
Beside this, extra judicial killings, the attack of hospitals and other medical facilities have almost become normal.
It’s common place to see either fresh corpses or decomposed ones abandoned along the road, nearby bushes, in houses or family compounds with family members that most often don’t have the opportunity to mourn as human nature requires.
No Respect for the dead:
“The tradition of the church says, the dead must be treated with respect and charity in faith and hope of resurrection “.
This Lenten pastoral letter says does not longer exist in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon today.
People are not only killed indiscriminately but bodies mutilated with body parts like hands, legs and head cut off and displaced in public places as if to say trophies of war.
Archbishop Cornilius Esua and Bishop Bibi have stated that human life remains sacred from conception to natural birth with man that originates from God and returns to God when he dies.
During this period of lent, leaders of the catholic church in Bamenda call upon all the faithful and people of good will to pray together, reason together,

decide together, and act together, so that the truth may prevail and the sacredness and the dignity of human life be respected.
The pastoral letter equally request the authorities of Cameroon to value man created in the image of God by taking decisions that will stop what the Archbishop and the bishop of Bamenda call “ …senseless and fratricidal war”.
